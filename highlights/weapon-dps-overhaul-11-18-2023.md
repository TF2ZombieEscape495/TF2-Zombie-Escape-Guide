Summary of Changes:&#x20;

These consist of changes to almost all primary and secondary weapons for every class.

There is much to discuss on every single change: What was the purpose? How does this affect class roles? Is this too OP? Is this too nerfed? What is the new overall dynamic?

Originally, a 100+ page document was written covering everything, but that's been left out. What remains here are just the changes and reasons for specific weapon changes. These are some thoughts players may want to consider for themselves and discuss for future reference.

In terms of DPS ranges, the following will summarize the average DPS values among primary and secondary weapons for each calss rounded to the nearest 5th:

* **Class** - **Primary** - **Secondary**
* **Scout** - 160 - 140
* **Soldier** - 160 - 110
* **Pyro** - #N/A - 145
* **Demoman** - 130 - 65
* **Heavy** - 235 - 140
* **Engineer** - 85 - 90
* **Medic** - 130 - #N/A
* **Sniper** - 150 - 170
* **Spy** - #N/A - 170

The above values do include weapons that deal no damage. Average by using sum of max damage from either secondaries or primaries: \~154. Values provided below regarding a weapon's attack timings, damage values, or any attributes may differ in actual gameplay.
