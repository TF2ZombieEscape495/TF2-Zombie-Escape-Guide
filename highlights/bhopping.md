# (NEW) Bhopping

_This page has received a small touchup to be on the forefront now that real bhopping is enabled on TF2 ZE!_

Similar to surfing, bhopping is a gameplay element with resources available that cover it extensively. If you want to learn how to do it, there are a plethora of guides and video references to look through, as well as maps to practice on. **This section briefly addresses it and its niche usage in TF2 ZE.**

**Prior to** **12/9/2024** - bhopping used to be very negligble in gains as there wasn't a bhop plugin and the gamemode's movement was very central on knowing which speed modifier weapons to use _**(those are still relevant on specific maps that disable bhop outright.)**_

{% hint style="info" %}
**With the bhop plugin - there's a few caveats on how it flows on TF2;**

* &#x43;_**urrently** it is encouraged to spacebar bhop than use traditional scroll-wheel methods._
* **Capped to 500 at max vel;** momentum should also be capped at stairs and ramps
* **\[ZOMBIE-ONLY]** Bhopping momentum is halted upon being shot/you shouldn't be able to boost yourself by getting shot in specific ways due to slowdown mechanics
* **Bhopping velocity limited to 250 upon using Zombie Enzymes.**
{% endhint %}

### **"But why should I learn it?"**

Unlike surf mechanics where you might only apply to a few non-surf maps, <mark style="color:yellow;">**bhopping**</mark> is a mechanic you'll find in other source games and learning the essence of it can help translate to those respective games - among being able to apply this movement mechanic to **almost\*** any map that has it enabled. It seriously makes a **massive** difference in your overall playstyle and lets you accomplish so much things faster that holding W into everything falls short of. Such as...

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Overcome slower class base movement speed**</mark>
  * Tired of waddling in and out every defense as a demoman or soldier who **typically\*** can't use their TF2 movement mechanics to compensate their slow base speed? Bhopping should alleviate this for the most part.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rushing for Triggers**</mark>
  * Lessen the pressure on teammates during tight holds. Having someone rush to the end/next trigger area with this mechanic can cut down on map timeouts and make a defense so much shorter than it needs to be.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rushing for Items**</mark>
  * Rush ahead of teammates to yoink items or save them from a person who won't use them properly.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Falling Back**</mark>
  * Zombies are slightly faster than humans in base speed. Use bhops to outpace them or even make tight timings if falling back particularly late and cover for those who cannot master bhop mechanics - shooting Zombies will stop them from bhopping.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Infecting Fleeing Humans**</mark>
  * Use that extra speed to catch up faster to humans running away - **especially those who are unable to cover tight corner areas** where you can fly out at full speed for an infect.
