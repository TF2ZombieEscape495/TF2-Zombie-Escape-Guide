# Gamemode Changes 12/16/2024

### 12/16/2024 - Crouching + Jump

* _Normally_ in TF2, you can't hold crouch _and then_ jump _(not to be mistaken with jumping and tapping crouching for more height)_
* **As of now on ZE servers, you can now 'crouch-jump' without having to sit through an awkward un-crouch animation.**
* **More bhop adjustments&#x20;**_**(may not be final)**_

### 12/9/2024 - Bhopping Update

* **Bhopping mechanics enabled on both Zombie Escape servers&#x20;**_**(capped to 500 at max, momentum should also be capped at stairs and ramps)**_
* **Bhopping momentum halted upon being shot/can't boost yourself by getting shot in specific ways.**
* **Bhopping velocity limited to 250 upon using Zombie Enzymes.**

### **11/26/2024 - General**

* **Map RTV Cooldown reduced back to global 3 map cooldown**
* **Adjustments made to sources of zombie boosting&#x20;**_**(this will probably throw off a lot of mention of boosting mechanics throughout the whole guide depending on whether or not it's adjusted any further)**_

### **11/6/2024 - Leader Nominations**

* **Specific maps can now&#x20;**_**only**_**&#x20;be nominated by an in-game** [**leader**](../general-overview/leading.md) **but are guaranteed to show on nom-list if it's a leader-map (A-Z)**
* **Nomination-stacking a map also now prioritizes whichever maps have the highest nom-counts into showing up on the RTV screen - but there is now a cap of 3 possible maps max (and 4 maps if leader nomination is there)**

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note:**</mark>_ **You can view what Leader maps are tagged as&#x20;**<mark style="color:purple;">**(LEADER)**</mark>**&#x20;@** [**Map List**](map-list-+map-records/) **or can view them in-game at the end of the nomination list.**
{% endhint %}

### **10/24/2024 - Maps re-added + Map CD Increase**

* [16 Maps Re-Added ](map-list-+map-records/recent-maps-11-13-2023.md#id-10-24-2024-16-maps-re-added)
* ~~Map CD increased to **20 map cooldown**~~
* **Map RTV timer lowered to 30 seconds (no longer have to wait 10 minutes to RTV on a map)**

### **9/21/2024 - Normal Mode Change**

* ~~_**(Unknown specific date)**_~~**&#x20;Universal 40% map damage reduction reverted/removed on** [<mark style="color:orange;">**Normal Mode.**</mark>](../general-overview/mod-mechanics.md#modes)
* &#x20;_tl;dr a lot of intended 1-shot mechanics like map traps/zombie items were 'broken' prior to this, and could just be tanked/or healed off without punishment; but should work again now. As a result, many maps will feel 'harder' again as you'll be taking lots more damage generally._

### **9/14/2024 - Leader Changes**

* **Leader functionality (markers and leadermenu) will be disabled upon Leader's death - they will still retain the role and can !transferleader to another player or hold it until next round.**
* _**(Admin only/event only?)**_**&#x20;Leader vip mode toggle added to leader options (round will instantly end on leader death)**

### 8/24/2024 - 23 maps purged

putting it on the forefront _outside a subpage_ since <mark style="color:red;">**>23 maps were removed**</mark> and [legacy maps](map-list-+map-records/legacy-maps.md) is a bit far too messy messy to find a way to organize into it.

## 2023

### 11/18/2023 Balance Change

<mark style="color:yellow;">**\~Human Demomen now have 200 HP with sticky/scottish/quickie equipped, still 175 if using a shield or jumper!**</mark>**&#x20;(This generally brings them up to par on NPCs/bosses with being able to take the same amount of hits as most other people.)**

### 11/7/2023 Enzyme Change

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Engineer</mark>

* #### _(-Unknown actual date of when this was implemented, likely snuck in during ZI/Halloween)_ <mark style="color:yellow;">Zombie Engineer's Enzyme can now EMP sentries to stop them from firing for a few seconds \[at a moderate range] and still can stun a single Human within melee range.</mark>

### 10/14/2023 Enzyme Change&#x20;

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Medic</mark>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Enzyme damage reduced by 50%**</mark>**&#x20;(averages to about \~20 raw damage on successful hit.)**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Correlating with the above; Enzyme on being hit increased by around \[6-8?] per damage tick**</mark>**&#x20;(Build enzyme much faster against damage.)**

### 7/28/2023 Enzyme Changes

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Medic</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Given a**</mark> [_**new ability**_](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-zombies/zombie-medic.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">**that allows the Zombie Medic to do an instant 30-60 damage to Humans in an AoE on activation; damage depending on range (and weapon interaction.) Does not infect upon kill as it deals crit damage.**</mark> (_**Prior enzyme was functionally broken.**_)

### 5/12/2023 Enzyme Changes

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Scout</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Only visually changed, grants the Zombie Scout a conch-like banner effect underneath themself.**</mark> _**(No longer gives speed line particles.)**_

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Demoman</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Refills charge meter to \~roughly \[95%] on use, allowing Zombie Demomen to do another follow-up charge. Does nothing if charge meter already full.**</mark> _**(Gives demoman an enzyme to begin with.)**_
