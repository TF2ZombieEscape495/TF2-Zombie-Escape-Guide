# Balance Changes 2/17/2024

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note:**</mark> Here's a quick page highlighting any recent significant changes to 'balance' changes that aren't just weapon changes; usually enzymes. The rest of the enzyme capabilities can be found in [**Zombie Overviews**](../general-overview/how-to-play-as-zombies/zombie-mutations-overview.md) **(Simplified)** and [**Meet The Zombies subpages**](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-zombies/) **(Detailed.)**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**\~Human Demomen now have 200 HP with sticky/scottish/quickie equipped, still 175 if using a shield or jumper!**</mark>** (This generally brings them up to par on NPCs/bosses with being able to take the same amount of hits as most other people.)**

### 11/7/2023 Enzyme Change

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Engineer</mark>

* #### _(-Unknown actual date of when this was implemented, likely snuck in during ZI/Halloween)_ <mark style="color:yellow;">Zombie Engineer's Enzyme can now EMP sentries to stop them from firing for a few seconds \[at a moderate range] and still can stun a single Human within melee range.</mark>

### 10/14/2023 Enzyme Change&#x20;

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Medic</mark>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Enzyme damage reduced by 50%**</mark>** (averages to about \~20 raw damage on successful hit.)**

### 9/24/2023 Balance & Enzyme Change

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Enzyme**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">** **</mark>_<mark style="color:yellow;">**only increases**</mark>_<mark style="color:yellow;">** **</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**upon taking damage and decays after a while;**</mark>** **<mark style="color:orange;">**(Enzyme count decays after \[30] seconds)**</mark> **(In other words; you can't indefinitely hold onto an enzyme activate them en masse after being jailed a long time.)**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Correlating with the above; Enzyme on being hit increased by around \[6-8?] per damage tick**</mark>** (Build enzyme much faster against damage.)**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Human melees no longer do increased damage and instead will do a sizeable knockback.**</mark>** (Still damages heavy enzymes greatly.)**

### 7/28/2023 Enzyme Changes

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Medic</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Given a**</mark> [_**new ability**_](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-zombies/zombie-medic.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">**that allows the Zombie Medic to do an instant 30-60 damage to Humans in an AoE on activation; damage depending on range (and weapon interaction.) Does not infect upon kill as it deals crit damage.**</mark> (_**Prior enzyme was functionally broken.**_)

### 5/12/2023 Enzyme Changes

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Scout</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Only visually changed, grants the Zombie Scout a conch-like banner effect underneath themself.**</mark> _**(No longer gives speed line particles.)**_

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Pyro</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Zombie Pyros now gain a giant bomb head upon enzyme, does immense damage at close range; has a wind-up AoE explosion that launches zombies forwards if not shot before it times out.**</mark>** **_**(No longer has the flame particles around him visually.)**_

#### <mark style="color:red;">Zombie Demoman</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**-Refills charge meter to \~roughly \[95%] on use, allowing Zombie Demomen to do another follow-up charge. Does nothing if charge meter already full.**</mark> _**(Gives demoman an enzyme to begin with.)**_
