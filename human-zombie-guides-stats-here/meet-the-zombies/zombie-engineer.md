Being unable to utilize most of the special attributes of his wrenches and being unable to set up buildings, the Engineer plays like your standard zombie. His mutation particularly specializes in punishing overdefenders that are far too aggressive (ideally nearly within melee range) to lock them _(singular)_ down in place - and it also acts as a tool to disable multiple sentries within a more moderate range; letting your teammate zombies destroy any pesky wrangled sentries in tight enclosures to push into them.

On using his Mutation, there will be half a second delay before the Engineer will stun himself and a human nearby him for approximately <mark style="color:yellow;">**\~1 second.**</mark> This isn't all that useful if you're by _yourself_ as both you and the trapped human will break free at the same time. With teammates backing you, it's a different story. This is the type of Mutation that has to be popped with a bunch of other zombies following in tow. When you see lone overdefenders like a Pyro trying to stall up close or a slow Heavy trying to run away, you can use your ability to freeze them while your teammates rush in for the kill.
