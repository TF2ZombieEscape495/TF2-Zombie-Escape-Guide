The Sniper acts like your standard zombie, there's not many gimmicks he can rely on until his enzyme charges. When this happens, you'll see how his insane damage as a human translates.\
\
On using his Mutation, humans within a radius around him will be coated in Jarate for several seconds. Their visibility will be impaired while they take increased damage from most sources of damage, such as from zombie hits and explosions. Most dangerously, however, is going be his Bushwacka. Pair that with his ability and you can one-shot _kill_ any class regardless of overheal. When you kill a human rather than infect them, you won't be stunned. So, if you're able to pop your Mutation and launch yourself into a crowd of humans, expect a big trim.
