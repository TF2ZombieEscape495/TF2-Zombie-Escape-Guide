While you can play as brazenly as you want as Spy on the Human team, as a zombie you have to be more calculating and cunning. The Spy boasts the highest damage as a zombie without the assistance of Mutations being able to backstab a human for **300** damage. This will kill **most classes** with normal overheal. Capitalize on this by running up to retreating humans or strafe jumping around corners to catch them from behind. If the Human team isn't careful, you can even try to surf their boosts to launch yourselves up and over them straight into an airstab.

But, the Human team won't always be this careless. That's where Spy's Mutation comes in to give you another edge to your game plan. Upon using his ability, <mark style="color:red;">**you drop drastically in health (to around 150 hp)**</mark> **but become invisible for several seconds.**&#x20;

You won't decloak while getting shot and will only do so on death, once the duration ends, or if you get close enough to a human. The decloak sound effect is relatively loud and global as well, so expect to be hard targeted once uncloaked. With all these factors in mind, your opportunity to strike will have a fairly small time window and will come up rarely with a smart enough Human team. As long as you play it smart, you should be able to net a few of them.
