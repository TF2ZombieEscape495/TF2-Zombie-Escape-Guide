As a zombie, the pyro has a lot of utility at his disposal with the different effects provided by his melee items. Aside from that, he's relatively fast, so he can try to weasel his way through humans while still being able to one-shot most of them.\
\
On using his Mutation, Pyro will drastically drop in health gain **a giant bomb head** (with a timer to automatically explode if not shot.) On death, he will explode, causing explosive damage to all surrounding humans (up to 10 humans max) while setting them on fire. Alone, this won't offer much due to the many healing sources at the Human team's disposal. As a result, it's best to use it in tandem with Mutations to stack damage.

Given that most people don't like being will panic if they lose too much health, you can also use this to disrupt the Human team. You'll be able to take care of backtracking overdefenders if they miss their shots, as the bomb on contact damage will very likely instantly kill someone at point-blank.\
\
For melee weapons, there is a lot to play around with. If you need to move fast but can handle the knockback from the damage vulnerability, you can use the Powerjack. If you want to take out Medics healing any overdefenders, use the Third Degree to damage both the defender _and_ the Medic. If you want increased damage in general, use the Back Scratcher. If you want to take out burning humans, use the Axtinguisher.
