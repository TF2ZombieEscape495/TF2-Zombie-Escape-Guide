As a zombie the Soldier doesn't really offer anything at all. The only gimmick he has is the Half-Zatoichi to oneshot any human Demomen or Soldiers using them.&#x20;

His Mutation isn't the best either as it is _very_ situational with Soldier being one of the _**slowest**_ Zombie classes. The pain-train speed boost does not function on him to circumvent this.

The Soldier Enzyme simply has **one** function - and that's beefing up your melee damage (by giving yourself minicrits.) This will last for about <mark style="color:yellow;">**(8 seconds)**</mark> before wearing out. That's all it does.

**The use of minicrits as a zombie when in most instances you'll be one-shotting base HP Humans anyway...?** _No good._ Especially with Zombie Heavy still around in town to dish out _even higher_ damage and defense-breaking potential.\

Mostly left in the mud enzyme-wise after the removal of their prior enzyme.
