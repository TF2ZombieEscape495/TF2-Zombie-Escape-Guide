# Meet The Zombies

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Meet The Zombies Test.png" alt="" width="479"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Below are descriptions for each class of the Zombie team, their Mutations, and weapons if they are of note. There isn't as varied a weapon pool as the Human team since they are restricted to only melees. As a result, this section will not be as extensive as the Meet the Humans section but will provide enough information for you to fully understand how to play as a zombie. For more in-depth playstyle  strategies, see the [**Zombie Meta Discussion**](../zombie-meta-discussion/) **- and for additional mechanics not covered here&#x20;**~~_**(until/unless author finds a way to cohesively merge that here)**_~~**&#x20;view** [**Zombie Mechanics**](../../general-overview/how-to-play-as-zombies/zombie-mechanics.md)

## Items & Enzyme...

## Health Scaling

* Normal = 1200 HP
* Scout and Demo = 600 HP
  * **Formula for zombie HP is as follows:**
  * Normal Zombie HP = ceiling (1200 \* h^(0.9))
  * Scout/Demo HP = ceiling (600 \* h^(0.9))
  * where _h_ is the number of humans alive upon spawning as a zombie
  * Thus, at 27 Humans, newly-spawned Zombies will have around 23303 HP, or 11651 HP for Zombie Scouts and Zombie Demos

## Building Damage

All Damage values provided for each class assume Stock melee.

* Normal damage vs. buildings: **97**
* Scout bat vs. buildings: **52**
* Spy knife vs. buildings: **60**

## Movement Speed Comparisons

ZE base movement speed _(from fastest to slowest; not accounting in any modifiers like weapons!!)_

1. Scout
2. Spy
3. Medic
4. Pyro = Engineer = Sniper
5. Soldier = Heavy
6. Demoman

Base move speed of all classes in ZE is 90% of their base move speed in vanilla TF2. Moving backwards decreases movement speed to 90% of base move speed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ignoring loadouts, zombies will normally move **\~1%** faster than their human counterparts. _**Some maps, items in those maps, or segments may speed up zombies even further.**_

_**(Mako V6, Malgo, etc...)**_
