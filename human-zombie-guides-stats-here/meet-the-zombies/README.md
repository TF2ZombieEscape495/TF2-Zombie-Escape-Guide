# Meet The Zombies

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Meet The Zombies Test.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Below are descriptions for each class of the Zombie team, their Mutations, and weapons if they are of note. There isn't as varied a weapon pool as the Human team since they are restricted to only melees. As a result, this section will not be as extensive as the Meet the Humans section but will provide enough information for you to fully understand how to play as a zombie. For more in-depth playstyle suggestions or strategies, see the [**Zombie Meta Discussion**](../zombie-meta-discussion/).

## Health Scaling

Normal = 1200 HP\
Scout and Demo = 600 HP\
\
**Formula for zombie HP is as follows:**\
&#x20;Normal Zombie HP = ceiling(1200 \* h^(0.9))\
&#x20;Scout/Demo HP = ceiling(600 \* h^(0.9))\
where _h_ is the number of humans alive upon spawning as a zombie\
\
Thus, at 27 humans, newly-spawned zombies will have around 23303 HP, or 11651 HP for zombie Scouts and Demos.

## Damage

All Damage values provided for each class assume Stock melee.

* Normal damage vs. buildings: **97**
* Scout bat vs. buildings: **52**
* Spy knife vs. buildings: **60**

## Movement Speed Comparisons

ZE base movement speed (from highest to lowest):

**Scout** > **Spy** > **Medic** > **Pyro** = **Engineer** = **Sniper** > **Soldier** = **Heavy** > **Demoman**

Base move speed of all classes in ZE is 90% of their base move speed in vanilla TF2. Moving backwards decreases movement speed to 90% of base move speed.

Ignoring loadouts, zombies move \~1% faster than their human counterparts.
