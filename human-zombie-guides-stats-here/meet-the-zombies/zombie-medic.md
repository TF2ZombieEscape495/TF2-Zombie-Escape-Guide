Medics provide support for the Zombie team in the same way that they do for the Human team. He plays by aiding his teammates so _they_ can hopefully whittle Humans down in his stead, but his Enzyme does have some sting capability when used right. Since zombies are restricted to melee, a strong weapon at his Amputator which allows him to taunt-heal everybody nearby. It won't be much, but it can top off your Zombie Item users so they don't instantly die or if they pop a mutation and need to make a final charge. Additionally, you can use it to point farm.

Use his Mutation if you want to pile on free damage onto the Humans who might not have healing at all times - or combo it on a Human that you are just about to melee _(You'll need to land the **enzyme**_ _**first**, before melee;_ _otherwise it will cap the person's health at 1 HP and not kill them. )_

This enzyme **also has a very large usage range** so make out of that what you can - use it in groups right after a boss arena to trim down someone that was already whittled away at by the boss attacks. It has a pretty moderate range both vertically and horizontally too, but if the Humans have enough healing they can shrug it off much probably. Use it to throw Humans off their rhythm in parkour segments via spontaneously getting damaged.

**The Solemn Vow** allows for Zombie Medic to view the HP of humans on their crosshair - allowing for zombie medic to reliably gauge when players are low enough in health (via crosshair) to pop the enzyme for a nasty finisher combo from a melee and to not be penalized for damage like the amputator is. It's also a very useful tool to trim down pesky dead-ringer spies by making them waste their dead-ringer charge earlier than they expected.
