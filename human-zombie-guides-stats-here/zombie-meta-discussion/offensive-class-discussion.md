# Offensive Class Discussion

## Scout

Scout deals a pitiful 82 damage per hit, which his faster firing speed cannot compensate for. Most of the time, you usually only get one hit on a survivor before being shot away. He also has half the HP of the other zombie classes and takes more knockback. As a result, you shouldn't expect many kills with him. He does, however, have one of the most powerful Mutations in the zombie arsenal: the ability to greatly increase the speed of himself and his comrades.

You should typically use his Mutation when the humans are falling back. Overdefenders or those that fall behind will be punished, since the zombies will rapidly catch up to them and infect them. You could also combine this with your fellow Heavies and Pyros to help them gain a lot more distance while enzymed. No matter how hard defenders backpedal, they won't be able to escape.

Treat Scout as more of a support zombie. You should choose Scout for maps with a lot of fallbacks or if you have some skilled or coordinated enough teammates. The only Scout melee worth using is his stock melee and their reskins, as his other options are either banned or ineffective.

## Soldier

**Soldier is one of the worst zombies to be blunt.** His enzyme currently has so little to go on about - that even explaining _why_ it's bad almost feels like a waste of time - but being given minicrits on usage is as nothing-burger as can be when you're _one of the slowest_ zombie classes around and already usually deal one-shot melees without enzyme usage. **Just honestly, switch to Warrior's Spirit Heavy** for a far more rewarding enzyme in most cases.\

Due to its extended range, the Half-Zatoichi is the only Soldier melee worth deploying if you decide to try and make this work. **While the Mantreads are useless as a humans, they are extremely useful to zombie Soldiers since they provide free knockback and airblast resistance.**

## Pyro

Pyro is one of the strongest zombies available. While Pyro doesn't have the same solo-killing power that the Heavy or Spy might have, when multiple zombies go Pyro and use their Mutations at the same time, the humans have very little chance of surviving the mass explosions. The pure existence of Pyro's Mutation also makes it that, once the humans lack healing, it's only a matter of time before they die out to the damage.

The way to play Pyro is very simple, try to gather with other zombies and activate your Mutation as soon as other Pyros or any other zombies in general pop theirs. Sniper's mutation can help increase the damage a bit by coating the humans in Jarate beforehand. You'd typically want to pick Pyro where the solo killing potential of the Heavy or Spy is very ineffective, there are multiple Pyros on your team already, of if the map already offers many sources of damage that'll bring the Human team low enough to be killed from your explosions.

Further strengthening Pyro are the melee weapons at his disposal. The Third Degree is the best pick for melee. Not only can it hit two humans at once, the healer and target, but if you do manage to infect the Medic they'll usually be in the backlines causing a panic in the Human team's defense. The Backscratcher is a good choice too since it packs more damage per hit, enough to punch through a Quick Fix's overheal. The Powerjack allows you to be faster with a negligible damage vulnerability as you'll usually wind up dead after using your Mutation. Even the Axtingusher can potentially be useful with its situational damage bonuses.
