# Support Class Discussion

## Medic

Due to Medic's relatively high speed and hp regen while retaining his one shot potential with the Bonesaw, he's the best zombie to carry items! Without considering items, his enzyme has some other niche usage like being able to poke at Humans who are already low health to **instantly** finish them off - _whereas a pyro enzyme would have to get shot first and run near them to blow up._ Use this right after Humans walk out of a boss fight and they'll probably explode.

Another utility for the zombie Medic is his Amputator being able to heal fellow zombies, especially if they need extra health to push or need to survive longer with items. Its decreased damage won't let you one-shot most humans, so it may be better to swap to Solemn Vow (to know about low HP humans that will die to your enzyme.) If the situation calls for stronger mass AoE damage, it may be better to swap to Pyro entirely. Although, don't discount situations where Medic may actually be useful, as their enzyme can sting hard at the right times.

## Sniper

The Sniper, similar to the Scout, is a support zombie, but with the added benefit of being extremely devastating if up close to humans. When humans are Jarated by the Sniper's Mutation, they will take additional damage from all sources of damage. That includes NPCs, bosses, other zombie Mutations like Pyro's and Medic's, and melee hits. Don't forget about your own damage as the Bushwhacka, zombie Sniper's best melee weapon, can virtually one shot any Jarated human that isn't a vaccinator-overhealed Heavy or Dead Ringer Spy thanks to its meaty \~600 damage crit.

A good time for Sniper's Mutation is when humans are about to take damage. So, when you hear the sound of a Pyro's Mutation activating, pop yours and hopefully you can stack enough damage to kill. Another interesting note is that Sniper's Mutation goes through walls. So, when you're aware of an attack that many humans will be damaged by, pop it and they'll take increased damage and possibly die from it as a result! You can even use it to impair the Human team's vision during sections where they're separated from the zombies, like during lasers, or you can even use his Mutation to reveal Spies. There's quite a bit of utility.

Adding to all this, Sniper is able to access his backpack items as a zombie. The only one worth using is the Razorback as it allows you to negate a backstab in times where you might need to carry a zombie item around. Bushwhacka is really the only melee Sniper should use for that extremely satisfying one-shot. The best time to pick Sniper is when there's a difficult boss that damages humans a lot, when you have lots of Pyros, or if you simply just enjoy insta-killing humans.

## Spy

The Spy is one of the most feared zombies on wide, open maps. Although humans can survive a butterknife from him, a Spy's backstab can easily kill a Heavy or a normal overhealed human in one shot. Their mere presence will keep the Human team on edge! This heightened awareness does mean humans may be constantly shooting at and checking different flank routes for zombies. As a result, you'll just have to play it smart and find opportunities as you go.

When a Spy activates their Mutation, they turn invisible but have drastically reduced HP. You remain cloaked until you get near an enemy, until a good amount of time has passed, or until you die. Once you uncloak, you make a global sound cue that every human can hear! Playing a good Spy is all about having proper map knowledge and good pathing. Activate your Mutation when out of view of the humans and try to approach from an angle where the humans might not expect a zombie from. This may include running from behind while they backpedal to shorten their time to react and turn around, or even cheekier stuff like strafe jumping around props or corners to corner stab them.

The best time to pick Spy is when the map is very open or there are many routes for zombies to flank the humans. Recall that he's limited to his stock knife, so make the most of your skills as a zombie.
