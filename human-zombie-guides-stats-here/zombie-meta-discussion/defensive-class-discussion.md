# Defensive Class Discussion

## Demoman

If you're playing Demoman, you'll really be playing just Demoknight. Unfortunately, it's a shell of its former self and has a lot of crippling downsides that make it not as good as you think. Demo is very similar to Scout in that he does less base damage to humans, takes more knockback, and has half the HP of regular zombies. He also has no Mutation due to his ability to charge. The charge, however, is much weaker due to being unable to trimp since you lose all momentum if you try to charge midair. Its charge meter even regenerates much slower than in vanilla TF2 and you'll lose all of it if you get hit while charging!

As such, Demoknight can be good against humans falling back as the charge allows you to catch up to them quickly. That quick burst of speed combined with the **increased melee damage while charging** could easily let you execute an unaware survivor in one shot via minicrit! However, more wise overdefenders will tend to shoot while falling back so even that might not be as effective.

As for weapons, Demo does have a versatile amount of options to choose from. Remember that Demoknight can use his booties, so you should always have them equipped. As for shields, the Splendid Screen is the best option due to its faster recharge rate, but the Tide Turner can be useful if you like to charge around corners. The Chargin' Targe may make you more survivable against fire and explosives, which could potentially help if you want to live longer.

For melees, you have your choice between the Ullapool Caber, Claidheamh Mòr, and Pain Train. The Claidheamh Mòr is the go-to weapon due to its charge duration increase and the damage vulnerability debuff is mostly negligable. The Pain Train can make you faster, but you lose out on the extended range of the swords. The Ullapool Caber has been nerfed and does not have the giant explosion radius one may be accustomed to, but it lets you one shot a human on your first hit with this weapon. You can also hit humans through some walls if the explosive damage pierces through.&#x20;

All the other weapons are outclassed as the Persian Persuader and Half-Zatoichi are outclassed by the Claidheamh Mòr, the Eyelander is unable to collect heads, the Bottle is outclassed by the Pain Train, and the Scotman's Skullcutter just barely misses the threshold to oneshot a typical human at 200 HP while penalizing you with a crippling move speed penalty.

## Heavy

The **most feared zombie** by far, Heavy is the go-to zombie for most maps when you truly want to make sure the humans don't win. He may be slow, but remember that he takes less knockback due to his weight! At first glance, his Mutation might not be that strong as it only lets you move a few feet before being frozen in-place where you're at the mercy of bloodthirsty humans. However, that small amount of distance is extremely efficient at killing any overconfident defender who moves a bit too far into the zombies. His Mutation is the best for forcefully pushing through chokepoints that the humans absolutely have locked down.

In order to capitalize on the strength of Heavy's mutation, you'll need to understand its timing and the ways you can make the most of its short duration. First, before popping it you'll need to gain enough starting momentum. Recall that taking damage from humans will slow you down thus stopping you before you can get within kill range. Avoid this by staying out of the firing line or by gaining a running start around corners. You can close greater distances with more speed, so use Scout speed boosts or even bunny hop if you can. Second, once you get a feel for when the Mutation ends, time a melee hit for when you're close enough to a Human and about to be frozen. There's a slight delay before your hit will land, so try to swing just before you get in range.

Playing zombie Heavy properly comes with experience and practice. Once mastered, you'll be an extreme dangerous threat the humans will always have to watch out for! You typically want to pick Heavy for most scenarios, but he's extremely strong in maps with tight chokepoints.

Heavy has quite the amount of tools to choose from. The Warrior's Spirit is a good choice for its insane damage bonus that most overheal can't save humans from. The Fists of Steel lets you tank a lot more punishment, which can be extremely helpful for tanking hits to prevent being shot to death while carrying an item. You will get one-shot instead of two-shot by melees, however. Holiday Punch can be useful for halting Spies or invulnerable humans by forcing them to laugh on punching them in the back. The Gloves of Running Urgently will trim your overall HP down to bullets rapidly but allows Heavy to be one of the fastest zombie! Especially given how your mutation is all about carrying that initial speed, it could carry you distances the other meles The KGB gives a extremely small advantage of making you 2% faster while also reducing your firing speed by 20% and the crits-on-kill typically won't matter. Finally, the Eviction Notice is a complete meme due to basically punching as hard as a Scout's fish.

## Engineer

The Engineer is extremely niche to play. While you can stun them with your Mutation, the range of it is not much bigger than your actual melee range. Not to mention, humans can easily protect the stunned human if they care enough. So, what is exactly the purpose of his Mutation? Well, the main purpose is to catch out any lone overdefenders who are trying to solo stall for their teams, or against players with the [**last survivor buff.**](../../general-overview/how-to-play-as-humans/human-mechanics.md#last-man-standing)

Due to how infrequently Engineer's Mutation is used, they'll most likely not even expect it. A Heavy could be too slow to catch up to them or the human might be aware of Spies trying to flank them, but they will never expect an Engineer using their Mutation in a giant horde. To use this effectively, you'll need to establish proper timing and be aware of the maximum distance your stun will reach. Once you know that, be sure to jump after using his Mutation as the momentum while stunned carries over! You can't receive knockback from most sources while stunned, which can easily catch them off guard. After being stunned, your teammates can easily clean up. Really, you should only pick Engineer if the Human team has known overdefenders or those unaware of how to properly counter an Engineer Mutation. Don't expect them to be fooled twice however!

The only Engineer weapon that actually gives a bonus to him is the Southern Hospitality. The bleed damage may situationally let you turn someone into a zombie in the backlines and the extra move speed is very nice; while increased fire vulnerability is pointless as fire is the least damaging source from the humans anyway.
