# Zombie Meta Discussion

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Zombie Strategies.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As a <mark style="color:red;">**Zombie**</mark>, you're probably very upset that you died, so you have to make sure those humans don't win without you! Your main goal is to make life as hard as possible for the <mark style="color:blue;">**Human**</mark> team. Be a hard target to shoot by constantly moving, jumping around, spreading out the horde, and taking alternate paths that the humans might not expect you to come from! Plus, you've even got [**Mutations**](../../general-overview/how-to-play-as-zombies/zombie-mutations-overview.md) to take advantage of or even nifty [**ZM items**](../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md) that the map might let you play around with.

...Author note; beware your eyes going into this segment as it gets a bit messy and haven't found a way to re-work it without just deleting it yet _(fate of the Human Meta Discussion...)_

_Like, a lot of it still should be relevant, but might not be accurate as weapon stats._
