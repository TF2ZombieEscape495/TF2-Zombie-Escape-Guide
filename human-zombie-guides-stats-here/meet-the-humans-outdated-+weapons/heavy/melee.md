# Melee

## Warrior's Spirit   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Warrior's\_Spirit.png)

| Attributes                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +30% Damage Bonus**</mark>                          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +50 Health Restored on Kill**</mark>                |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: +30% Damage Vulnerability on Wearer**</mark>         |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +7 Health Regenerated per second on Wearer**</mark> |

Providing a hefty **+7** <mark style="color:green;">**hp regen**</mark> while held out, the Warrior Spirit allows aggressive Heavies to play more independently from their team while also providing a way to heal without relying on lunch box items or if other healing sources are gone. While move speed can be nice, you are fast enough to reliably fall back and use shotguns to stall from behind _so long as there are few enough zombies._

## Eviction Notice   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Eviction\_Notice.png)

| Attributes                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+40% Faster Firing Speed**</mark>                   |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+8% Faster Move Speed on Wearer (276 hu/s)**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-60% Damage Penalty**</mark>                         |
| _<mark style="color:red;">**-100 Max Health on Wearer**</mark>_                 |
| <mark style="color:red;">**On Hit: Gain a Speed Boost**</mark>                  |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Max HP Drain Mechanic Disabled**</mark>           |

This option and the GRU are both equally balanced out in a sense that they offer **the same movement speeds for different forms of penalties** - and in this case, the Eviction Notice allows you to retain a high movement speed as Heavy _passively,_ rather than being held out. What's the cost? Losing -100 of your max health means you won't be able to tank as many things as you could before - maybe the one extra hit from a zombie is going to matter on you, had you been able to live two hits. You're effectively put into the same health pool as most light classes now; but you also have the option to cover with a secondary while retaining this speed bonus. Not that you normally would be meleeing zombies either, but you'll hit like a scout's fish even with a last survivor buff. It's really a matter of preference between Warrior's, GRU, or this on what you value most in your playstyle.

## Gloves of Running Urgently (GRU)   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Gloves\_of\_Running\_Urgently.png)

| Attributes                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +20% Faster Move Speed on Wearer (276 hu/s)**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-10% Slower Move Speed on Wearer (230 hu/s)**</mark>             |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Holster Speed**</mark>                                      |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Damage Vulnerability on Wearer**</mark>                     |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Max HP Drain Mechanic Disabled**</mark>                       |

An alternative to the previous two weapons, the Gloves of Running Urgently instead provide Heavy more speed when held out. While this is a great utility, the passive speed penalty forces the Heavy to fall back sooner and forces you to be be more passive by holding this out - definitely counterintuitive for the type of Heavies that like to shoot back with their shotguns while retreating. If you want that, look to the Eviction. Be mindful that the gloves **make you take more damage universally** while you're using them, to a point where almost anything, like NPCs, can one shot you while falling back! Generally, it's a preference between this and the Warrior's Spirit, as well as the Eviction notice - at a different tradeoff on the latter; maps with long runs would make this the more favored option, while maps with short routes and NPCs would make the Warrior's Spirit a more appealing option.

## Killing Gloves of Boxing   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Killing\_Gloves\_of\_Boxing.png)

| Attributes                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+2% Faster Move Speed on Wearer**</mark>                         |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: -20% Slower Firing Speed**</mark>                      |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**When Held: On Kill: 5 seconds of 100% critical chance**</mark> |

The Killing Gloves of Boxing gives Heavy a very small boost in speed while held out without the punishing attribute of passively slowing you down. That small little upside makes the KGB rank above the fists.

## Fists   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Fists.png)

Unlike all the other gloves weapons, at least you can try to taunt kill zombies with this.

## Holiday Punch   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Holiday\_Punch.png)

| Attributes                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Critical hit forces victim to laugh**</mark>                           |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Always critical hit from behind**</mark>                                 |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Hit: Force enemies to laugh who are also wearing this item**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Critical hits do no damage**</mark>                                    |

You can also taunt kill zombies with this, but, on the off chance you have Crits, you won't actually be able to harm zombies. Plus any Holiday Punch wielding zombie Heavy will force you to laugh regardless of whether you were hit on the back or not, usually causing you to die!

## Fists of Steel   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Fists\_of\_Steel.png)

| Attributes                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-100% Holster Speed**</mark>                         |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-40% Maximum Overheal on Wearer**</mark>             |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-40% Health from Healers on Wearer**</mark>          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: -40% Damage from Ranged Sources**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: +100% Damage from Melee Sources**</mark>  |

Increased melee damage against melee using enemies with a penalty to healing to boot. If you enjoy making sure you die outright in one shot rather than getting infected with this out, go right ahead.
