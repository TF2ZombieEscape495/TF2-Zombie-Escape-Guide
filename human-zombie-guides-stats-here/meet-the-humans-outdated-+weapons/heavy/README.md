With his massive guns and arsenal of weapons, Heavy's main job in Zombie escape is being the premier defender. Be at the frontlines and use your [Minigun options](primaries.md) to knock back and hold off zombies or provide cover for your teammates on retreat. If there are any NPCs or bosses around, he can shift position to becoming the peak damage dealer to mow them down due to his miniguns' high fire rate and high DPS.\
\
However, with such strength comes the downside of being slow and a main target for zombies. It'll take time for you to unrev your miniguns, so only do so when safe. On falling back, use shotguns to shoot behind to stall zombies or push them back if they get too close. Alternatively, if you want to maintain your health or act as a secondary Medic, you can equip [lunchables ](secondaries.md#second-banana)to use for yourself or to distribute to the team <mark style="color:red;">**though this leaves you at the mercy of your team covering your fallbacks.**</mark>\
\
The variety doesn't stop there as Heavy's got multiple melee weapons at his disposal as well. For example, if you want to move even faster you could equip the [Gloves of Running Urgently](melee.md#gloves-of-running-urgently-gru) or [Eviction Notice](melee.md#eviction-notice). If you want passive healing _(when held)_, look towards the [Warrior's Spirit](melee.md#warriors-spirit). There's a lot you can do. Heavy's playstyle may be fundamentally simple but there's enough versatility to showcase just how powerful he can be.
