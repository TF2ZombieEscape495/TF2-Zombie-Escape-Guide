## Shotgun   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Shotgun (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                    | Damage                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 18 Shots                                          | Clip DPS - 171.429 DPS          |

|                                                               | Reload Time (C) - 0.200 seconds |
|                                                               | Full Reload Time- 3.800 seconds |
|                                                               | **Real DPS** - 85.48 DPS        |

Allowing Heavy to play much more aggressive and giving him a way of defending himself while falling back, the Shotgun is the ideal and most used secondary for Heavies.

## Family Business   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Family\_Business (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                    | Damage                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 36 Shots                                          | Clip DPS - 235.29 DPS            |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+60% Faster Firing Speed**</mark> | Base Damage - 60 per shot        |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% Faster Reload Time**</mark>  | Attack Interval - 0.255          |
| <mark style="color:red;">**+70% More Accurate**</mark>        | TEC - 9.18 seconds               |
|                                                               | Reload Time (F) - 0.51 seconds   |
|                                                               | Reload Time (C) - 0.255 seconds  |
|                                                               | Full Reload Time - 9.435 seconds |
|                                                               | **Real DPS** - 116 DPS           |

Wait, this gun has even more accuracy and clip than a regular shotgun - why aren't I using this? Well, there is a catch - the _plus_ 70% accuracy stat means you're going to lose out on most of your spread when firing it; effectively making this a slug shotgun for picking out coupled zombies - you won't be hitting several targets with this consistently, so if more than one is behind you; it could spell your demise! What it excels in however is the boosted damage capability over a regular shotgun without revving up a minigun, this lets Heavy deal some proper big damage to things like NPCs and Laser Bosses while running/and or jumping.

## Panic Attack   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Panic\_Attack (3).png>)

| Attributes                                                                   | Damage                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Clip Size - 18 Shots                                                         | Clip DPS - 342.857 DPS         |

| <mark style="color:red;">**-60% Damage Penalty**</mark>                      | Reload Time (C) - 0.33 seconds |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Fires a wide, fixed shot pattern**</mark>      | Full Reload Time- 6.27 seconds |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Successive shots become less accurate**</mark> | **Real DPS** - 79.4 DPS        |
|                                                                              |                                |

An alternative option for the shotgun that can _also_ be used by Soldier, Pyro, and Engineer - This one succeeds well in providing a very short burst of cover for moments where zombies are right behind you and you need them off your tail. The extra deploy speed is going to help with that a lot from switching off your minigun and getting ready to run. Basically your primary condensed into a rapidly deployable burst option but you will have to lots of spend downtime reloading. Not exactly good for prolonged periods of delaying due to its accuracy falloff - which you do have a properly defending primary for; but also has the niche wherein if a map has an [**ammo item**](../../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md) you can activate that and absolutely **shred** down a boss with the insanely high firerate from using one of said infinite ammo powerups.

## Dalokoh's Bar   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Dalokohs\_Bar.png)

| Attributes                                                                                        |

With the quicker taunt speed, the bar becomes usable mid-combat and can be tucked away for a minigun rapidly. While more health is always more useful, the increased health that the Dalokohs Bar provides isn't as impactful on any _normal loadout._ The Dalokohs Bar brings your HP up to 350 passively while giving you 400 HP if you eat the bar. The problem being that most zombies will still two hit you like they normally do with your 300 HP. One niche of this that brings it higher tier-wise here is that when paired with the Eviction Notice - it can at least offset the HP penalty and move you up to 250 HP; this is elaborated on a bit more in [**Versatile Heavy**](../../human-meta-discussion-outdated-+loadouts/class-loadouts-demoman-heavy-engineer/#versatile-heavy) loadout.

Healing for survivors is generally plentiful and typically covered by other classes making lunchbox items not particularly that useful. They also prevent Heavies, one of the slowest classes in ZE, from safely falling back and defending themselves with a shotgun at the mercy of his team hopefully covering him. Although lunchbox items may help you heal off the damage you may take from zombies as the only class to be able to tank a regular zombie hit, **a shotgun will help prevent you from getting hit in the first place!** It's better to use the Warrior's Spirit to heal off any damage you may recieve for those solo Heavies instead of wasting time eating and not defending. They can help you heal your team but other sources of healing far surpasses what the lunchbox items can provide.

An alternative to the Sandvich, the Banana lets you heal yourself much more often at the cost of less healing for you and your teammates. Typically, you want to spend time actually defending rather than eating or throwing food at your teammates and if you're more the type to be far from your team, it's best to keep a handy shotgun on you to actually be able to defend yourself while on the move.

Melee only against the near unkillable zombies with one shot melees. Yeah....There's better classes to doorhug with, but the move speed can be situationally used to beat people to items quicker - unless they got a bonk boost or conch, _(as you're capped to 310 HU/s on use.)_
