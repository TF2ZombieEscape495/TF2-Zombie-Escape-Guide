The stock shotgun is pretty much the de facto weapon used by new players or those overwhelmed by all the weapon changes. It also sets the precedent for pretty much all shotgun-esque weapons. This weapon's base DPS is around \~150, which is a damage range all weapons will hover around with a lowered fire rate to compensate.

Reliable as a mid ranged option, the stock Shotgun is an excellent choice for Heavies that don't want to have a gimmicky secondary and are in need of a cover option after pulling away a minigun or are in a defense where they can't safely draw a minigun; or even during a boss where the Heavy might be jumping over specific attacks.

The Family Business in base TF2 is a weapon that allows Heavies to dish out more shots at a faster rate at the cost of damage per shot. As a fun fact, it even has an item-set relationship with the Tomislav. It maintains the **same functionality and relationship** in Zombie Escape, but with a particular emphasis on _accuracy._ This is done via a 50% accuracy bonus that reduces its spread to 60:1. This makes it slightly more accurate than both the Reserve Shooter and its Tomislav partner, but still less accurate than the pistols.

This means that this weapon can suppress zombies for a longer duration (with precision), but will be offset more greatly by the time taken to fully reload its cli.

As for the new dynamic this adds to the Heavy, it is still a shotgun that is risky to use with his playstyle. Heavies primarily defend with miniguns and, after doing so, take time to unrevv. This creates a period in which zombies can quite easily reach them. The large spread of normal shotguns can be much more beneficial for slowing larger groups of them down than high-accuracy weapons that hit fewer zombies. This is a risk players can take if they prefer other miniguns over the Tomislav but still need high accuracy to deal with certain DPS checks or boss fights.

The Panic Attack in base TF2 has gone through many revisions. It was originally a charged burst weapon that fired much faster the lower one’s health was. Now, it’s a rapid-fire burst weapon that loses accuracy the longer one keeps firing. These modifications follow the trend of the latter, as this weapon has been reworked into an immediate response option for players caught out by groups of zombies.

Currently the weapon stands as the **fastest-firing yet slowest-reloading** shotgun. With a TEC time of 2.43 seconds and a FRT of 5.4 seconds, this produces an extremely low uptime-downtime ratio of 0.45. This means that this weapon is **highly unsustainable for long-term defenses** and should only be used if necessary. This weapon has a 37% damage penalty, leading to the lowest sustained DPS among all shotguns at \~130. But, because this weapon boasts an extremely high fire rate, its nonstop DPS is actually **one of the highest among all weapons at 420 **_**(provided that you have an**_ [_**ammo item.**_](../../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md#human-items)_**)**_

Even if this weapon has low sustained DPS, it evens out by being given a damage bonus to players in an attempt to make it more effective for close-range knockback in hitting multiple zombies due to the spread 'penalty' applying to extra pellets. With all this in effect, hopefully this becomes a weapon Pyros, Heavies, and Soldiers can consider as an option should they tend to over-defend or get caught out often. The low damage and high spread also make this weapon less appealing for fast-moving boss fights, so try to _avoid_ using it on maps that require optimal DPS or accurate shots to win unless you're comfortable with getting up close.

While more health is always more useful, the increased health that the Dalokohs Bar provides isn't as impactful on any _normal loadout._ The Dalokohs Bar brings your HP up to 350 passively while giving you 400 HP if you eat the bar. The problem being that most zombies **will still two hit you** like they normally do with your 300 HP. One niche of this that brings it higher tier-wise here is that when paired with the Eviction Notice - it can at least offset the HP penalty and move you up to 250 HP; this is elaborated on a bit more in [**Versatile Heavy**](../../human-meta-discussion-outdated-+loadouts/class-loadouts-demoman-heavy-engineer.md#versatile-heavy) loadout.

Healing for survivors is generally plentiful and typically covered by other classes making lunchbox items not particularly that useful. They also prevent Heavies, one of the slowest classes in ZE, from safely falling back and defending themselves with a shotgun at the mercy of his team hopefully covering him. Although lunchbox items may help you heal off the damage you may take from zombies as the only class to be able to tank a regular zombie hit, **a shotgun will help prevent you from getting hit in the first place!** It's better to use the Warrior's Spirit to heal off any damage you may recieve for those solo Heavies instead of wasting time eating and not defending. They can help you heal your team but other sources of healing far surpasses what the lunchbox items can provide.

The Second Banana provides a slight increase to move speed while active, serving as an alternative to the GRU and synergizing with the Eviction Notice's passive move speed bonus (though it will not let you outrun Scouts in most cases). A massive holster penalty should discourage it being used to kite zombies and then swapping to the Minigun to halt pursuers.

Melee only against the near unkillable zombies with one shot melees. Yeah....There's better classes to doorhug with, _but_ the move speed can be situationally used to beat people to items quicker - unless they got a bonk boost or conch, _(as you're capped to 310 HU/s on use.)_\
\
At the very least, it can provide useful for making a getway in a snap if there's no teammates supporting you with speed buffs either, but you'll be down a defensive option for that whole \~16 seconds.
