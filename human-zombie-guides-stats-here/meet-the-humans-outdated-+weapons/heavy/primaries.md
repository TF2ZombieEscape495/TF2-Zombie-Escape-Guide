# Primaries

## Minigun   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Minigun (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                  | Damage                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-5% Slower Firing Speed**</mark> | Base Damage - 36 per shot |
|                                                             | Attack Interval - 0.105   |
|                                                             | **Real DPS** - 342 DPS    |

The Minigun is a reliable choice for Heavy much like the other picks It may have a wider spread, but this will let you hit more zombies per shot, causing a larger AoE slow. Pair it with crits if you really want to hold off a horde of zombies. It's preferential whether you want to use this or are experienced enough with the Brass Beast.

## Brass Beast   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Brass\_Beast (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                    | Damage                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+10% Damage Bonus**</mark>                                        | Base Damage - 39 per shot |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+10% Faster Firing Speed**</mark>                                 | Attack Interval - 0.09    |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**-20% Damage Resistance when below 50% Health and Spun Up**</mark> | **Real DPS** - 444 DPS    |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Slower Spin Up Time**</mark>                                  |                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-60% Slower Move Speed when Deployed**</mark>                      |                           |

Wielding the highest DPS in the game, the Brass Beast lets teams shred through NPCs, bosses, and zombies. It also does not have the slower firing speed that the other miniguns possess, making it slightly better at defending than the other options. However, the slower spin up and move speed require you to play more precariously. Offset this by knowing the best places to hold and defend, as well as when to fall back so you don't get caught by the slow un-rev. This can be a much better option than the Minigun or Tomislav when the map doesn't force you to move too much or if there are NPCs and bosses you have to kill.

## Natasha   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Natascha (3).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                    | Damage                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Faster Firing Speed**</mark>                                 | Base Damage - 25 per shot |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Bullets per Shot**</mark>                                    | Attack Interval - 0.075   |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**-20% Damage Resistance when below 50% Health and Spun Up**</mark> | **Real DPS** - 333 DPS    |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-44% Damage Penalty**</mark>                                       |                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Less Accurate**</mark>                                        |                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**30% Slower Spin Up Time**</mark>                                   |                           |

The Natasha is a unique pick in the sense that it trades having sustainable ammo - for a far more defensive option of a minigun. The extra bullets per shot and firing speed will effectively make this one of the more stronger miniguns at holding back zombies even with a penalizing accuracy _however_ that'll begin to falter when you start running out of ammo because of how fast it sprays bullets; so pray an engineer places some dispensers down for you. ~~Also has a nice sound to its rev up.~~

## Tomislav   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Tomislav (2).png>)  &#x20;

| Attributes                                                                 | Damage                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% Faster Spin Up Time**</mark>              | Base Damage - 36 per shot |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+20% More Accurate**</mark>                    | Attack Interval - 0.135   |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25% Slower Firing Speed**</mark>               | **Real DPS** - 266 DPS    |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Silent Killer: No barrel spin sound**</mark> |                           |

The Tomislav is as low as here rank-wise but is by no means anywhere in a bad state; it offers far quicker spin up time than all the other minigun options, allowing the Heavy to play more aggressively by jumping into the frontlines to quickly rev up and defend. The accuracy bonus can help you hold down zombies from getting too close, dispatch ones low on health, _and_ land your shots on NPCs and bosses. However, where it'll fall flat is the damage output compared to every other minigun; kinda the thing _most people want a heavy for_ - also losing out on the constant spray of bullets that stock can offer to flick between hoardes of zombies; but the accuracy will at least let you single out zombies **from afar** that might deem the most threat!

## Huo-Long Heater   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Huo-Long\_Heater (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                              | Damage                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+30% Faster Firing Speed**</mark>                           | Base Damage - 21 per shot |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Damage Bonus vs Burning Players**</mark>               | Attack Interval - 0.075   |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Bullets Per Shot**</mark>                             | **Real DPS** - 280 DPS    |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-70% Damage Penalty**</mark>                                 |                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Less Accurate**</mark>                                  |                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-20% Damage vs Players**</mark>                              |                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: Does not gain ammo from Dispensers.**</mark>      |                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**Consumes additional 6 ammo per second while Spun Up**</mark> |                           |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Creates a ring of fire while Spun Up**</mark>             |                           |

The Huo-Long Heater effectively acts as a faster Brass Beast/Natascha mix that very quickly loses its effectiveness in prolonged defenses and bosses. The fire-ring doesn't provide anything beneficial in stopping zombies. Can help shred down zombie HP on ZM items if your team has pyros lighting them up. Will also burn ammo far faster than the Natascha due to fire-ring but has no accuracy penalty either, letting you dish out bullets against hoardes well enough. Typically lasts around <mark style="color:yellow;">**\~12 seconds**</mark> of rev-up and firing time for full ammo depletion and will often need a dispenser to switch off the weapon _(and back)_; or an ammo box to repelenish.
