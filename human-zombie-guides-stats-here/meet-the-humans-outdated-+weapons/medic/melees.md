# Melees

## Solemn Vow   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Solemn\_Vow.png)

| Attributes                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+20% Heal Rate**</mark> |

The gamemode already allows for you to view zombie HP by placing your crosshair on them; so the benefit of that really doesn't matter at all. But the heal rate can get good mileage being paired with something like the Quick-Fix - especially in bosses with healing enabled that require you constantly moving around.

## Vita-Saw   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Vita-Saw.png)

| Attributes                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% Uber Build Rate Bonus**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% Uber Duration**</mark>         |

This one's actually not all too bad. It's a lot more niche in the sense that the stats will beef up your uber charge rate and the actual uber usage timer itself. It can get some use out of saving a person who got caught overdefending/on a teleport more reliably with an extra second or so if you're running Stock uber.

## Amputator   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Amputator.png)

| Attributes                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+3 Health Regenerated per second on Wearer**</mark>                   |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-20% Damage Penalty**</mark>                                           |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: Applies a healing effect to all nearby teammates**</mark> |

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note:**</mark>_** The Amputator now only heals at a limited, slowed rate upon alt-fire usage due to issues with healing particles on 64 players.**
{% endhint %}

It lets you AoE heal your team when taunting with it while also providing a nifty hp regeneration bonus when held out. With this, the Medic can either shift from fast and powerful single target healing to minor - but just as powerful - AoE healing. Just be careful with the taunting as you will be unable to move until either the taunt ends or you get hit by a zombie. As long as you use it wisely, the Amputator will allow you to save your team from Mutation spams or during NPC and Boss fights if not nerfed for them. One of the best medic melees even worth using, the others are a lot more niche for this mode.

## Übersaw   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Ubersaw.png)

| Attributes                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-100% Slower Firing Speed**</mark>       |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**On Hit: 50% ÜberCharge added**</mark> |

In a game mode where you can get one shot just by breathing on enemy players, the Ubersaw can be very risky to use. In most cases, you wouldn't even need to use it as you will be constantly healing teammates who will more than likely take damage to further increase your ÜberCharge build rate. To mitigate the risks, you could use it to hit zombies who can die in one shot for a quick ÜberCharge gain, _such as an enzyming Heavy_. In the cases where you aren't doing this, you might be trying to Medic train with another Ubersaw user and Stock Mediguns. Just know that the Medic's ÜberCharge has a -50% Duration Penalty stat, so trying to chain it might go horribly - you do only need roughly two hits though, but you're gonna _feel_ that slow swing speed.

## Bonesaw   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Bonesaw (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +3 Move Speed.**</mark> |

The extra movement speed is _very negligible_ when something like the Overdose can provide even higher speed and defensive cover at the same time - You'll be better off equipping any other melee above this.
