The team healer, Medic's main job in Zombie Escape is to keep the overall health of the team topped off against map hazards or Mutation spam. Your mediguns provide powerful single-target healing with the added benefit of providing overheals to tank zombie hits. If healing isn't your thing, the syringe guns do very nicely at stalling and holding back hordes of zombies due to their high firing rate.\
\
Mediguns come with the ability to ÜberCharge patients upon filling their meter enough. These are very situational but can be somewhat powerful. If a teammate is overdefending and gets caught out, you can pop a stock ÜberCharge to save them. If dying to NPCs, quickly heal them back to full with the Quick-Fix's ÜberCharge (invulnerability won't protect them from these sources of damage!). You can even use the Kritzkrieg's ÜberCharge to help bolster defenses somewhat.\
\
Aside from single-target healing, the Medic can also use AoE heals upon equipping the Amputator or Crusader's Crossbow. With the Amputator taunt, you can radially heal yourself and those around you while, with the Crossbow, shots will linearly penetrate teammates for burst healing. A Medic can be quite useful class for dealing with both TF2-exclusive challenges as well as any original map elements. Do note that his healing may be nerfed or disabled during certain areas requiring you to use syringe guns to defend or deal with obstacles.
