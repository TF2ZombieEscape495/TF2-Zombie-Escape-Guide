The Blutsauger is a common pick by Medics in base TF2 due to the appeal of its heal-on-hit mechanic. The lost health during regen doesn't seem to spark much concern, as players still use it to aggressively barrage enemies and get their health back from that instead.&#x20;

In Zombie Escape, it's much more appealing for a different mechanic, that being the added "mad milk syringes" attribute. This allows Medics to hit zombies and apply the Mad Milk effect, which will, in turn, **allows teammates to shoot said zombies and gain 60% of the damage dealt back as health.** This effectively changes Medic as a whole by simplifying the decision of having to prioritize concentrated healing versus defending to filling these two roles simultaneously, albeit with AOE healing instead.

This is what makes the Blutsauger, in particular, an **extremely powerful weapon.** It is versatile and doesn't come with many downsides. It retains a sustained DPS of \~160, which is the lowest among all syringe guns. But, even then, this isn't necessarily enough to outweigh the positives.

The stock Syringe Gun is a solid Medic primary in ZE. It has a high firing rate and decent DPS, but what's more, it's not hitscan. This lets you to halt hordes of zombies by volleying your rounds and waving your weapon left to right like a part-time Pyro. When you're falling back, it's even more effective since zombies will be running into your shots. This weapon does come with the drawback of your syringes being unable to pierce your teammates, requiring you to shoot at the front or whenever gaps open up between them; coupled with its clip size making it dangerous to be running out of ammo in the frontlines; but it's currently one of the _best choices for medic DPS_ hovering at \~181; especially if a boss toggles healing mechanics you should be using this!

The Overdose in base TF2 is a weapon primarily used for the increased speed it can give its users based on their ÜberCharge level. In Zombie Escape, it utilizes this same function as a weapon that primarily plays into the interests of Medics wielding it by allowing them to outspeed Scouts and Spies when running for certain objectives or items. With an increased fire rate and a lean toward support, this falls more akin to being a "burst" weapon. This gives it a middle-ground sustained DPS of \~170, but it also means that the Overdose _will empty much, much faster._ It will be up to the player to tap-fire to help sustain a defense or simply hold down their firing key for immediate suppression.

**The movement penalty currently provides the following speed values.**

* 300 HU/s × 0.9417 => <mark style="color:yellow;">**282.50 HU/s**</mark> _(Medic speed on maps **with** speed nerf **and no Overdose**)_&#x20;
* 282.50 HU/s × 0.885 = 250.0125 HU/s => <mark style="color:yellow;">**\*250.00 HU/s**</mark> _(Medic speed with Overdose held out and no boost)_
* 250.0125 HU/s \* 1.20 => <mark style="color:yellow;">**\*300.00 HU/s**</mark> _(Medic speed with Overdose held out and **full boost**)_
*
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**320 HU/s**</mark> _(Medic speed on maps **without** speed nerf **and no Overdose**)_
* 320 HU/s × 0.885 = 283.20 HU/s => <mark style="color:yellow;">**\*283.00 HU/s**</mark> _(Medic speed with Overdose held out and no boost)_
* 283.20 HU/s × 1.20 => <mark style="color:yellow;">**\*340.00 HU/s**</mark> _(Medic speed with Overdose held out and **full boost**)_

The Crusader’s Crossbow is a weapon used for burst healing teammates, particularly those out of range of Medi-Guns. These attributes reflect more of the burst healing aspect by decreasing its firing rate penalty and increasing its reload rate, as well as providing numerous support buffs to your Secondary choice of Medi-Gun. This burst effect _also_ plays into its linear AOE stall making it more effective when unloaded all at once; such as for falling back on, but is less consistent over the duration of a defense.

<mark style="color:red;">**Unfortunately, this weapon cannot deal damage to NPCs or bosses.**</mark> To compensate for this, it has been given an additional supportive option of slowing enemies hit arrows to a minimum of <mark style="color:yellow;">**270 HU/s**</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">**for 3 seconds.**</mark> Although, this has proven to provide minimal benefit already depending on the map. This is mainly to follow the trend of piercing weapons providing a longer-lasting slow at the cost of their fire rate similar to the Ambassador.
