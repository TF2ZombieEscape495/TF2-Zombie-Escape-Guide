The stock Syringe Gun is a solid Medic primary in ZE. It has a high firing rate and decent DPS, but what's more, it's not hitscan. This lets you to halt hordes of zombies by volleying your rounds and waving your weapon left to right like a part-time Pyro. When you're falling back, it's even more effective since zombies will be running into your shots. This weapon does come with the drawback of your syringes being unable to pierce your teammates, requiring you to shoot at the front or whenever gaps open up between them; coupled with its clip size making it _dangerous_ to be running out of ammo in the frontlines.

The Blutsauger turns out to be a poor choice at solo defending hordes of zombies when being put up against its competition picks, particularly with decreased knockback. However, what it lacks in defense comes full circle in its **team support;** _all syringes_ hitting a zombie will apply a temporarily mad milk _<mark style="color:green;">(</mark><mark style="color:green;">**healing on hit)**</mark>_ douse on hit - with duration prolonged if you keep landing your hits on them. Syringes will still be blocked by your teammates though, so make sure you jump often or strafe around them while firing these.

## Overdose   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Overdose (3).png>)

| <mark style="color:red;">**-15% Decreased Firing Rate**</mark>                                                                                        |  **Real DPS** - 174 DPS      |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: -13% Speed Penalty**</mark>                                                                                     |                              |

Stronger syringes, slightly more uptime, slightly faster (movement) while deployed at the cost of weaker uber, healing, and boss DPS; basically a rolling into the battle medic playstyle - also allows medic to reliably gain speed over most of the other classes while holding out their primary; useful for situations like backpedaling defense (even with the reduction in speed from holding back) you'll be like a scout in speed.

## Crusader's Crossbow   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Crusader's\_Crossbow (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clip Size - 3 Shots                                                            |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+35% Faster Reload Time**</mark>                   |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% Heal Rate**</mark>                            |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% Ubercharge Rate**</mark>                      |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Overheal Build Rate**</mark>                  |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-3x Slower Firing Speed**</mark>                    |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Hit: 3% UberCharge added**</mark>             |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Projectiles penetrate players**</mark>           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**Projectile cannot damage breakable objects**</mark> |

Playing a much more supportive role, the Crusader's Crossbow lets you heal several members of your team at once with its player penetration attribute. The burst heal can be very useful for saving teammates during boss fights that allow healing - as well as mass-healing clusters of teammates _before_ a boss fight turns off any sources of healing, and it can reach people outside of medigun range. This does all come at the cost of not having a syringe gun for defensive capabilities **(and you will be contributing zero boss DPS.)**
