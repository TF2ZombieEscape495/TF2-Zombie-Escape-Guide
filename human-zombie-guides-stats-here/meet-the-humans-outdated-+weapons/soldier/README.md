A Soldier's main job in Zombie Escape is to support the team with various banner effects while slowing the zombies down with AoE explosives. His rocket launchers may be easy to use, but they can prove to be very dangerous. Plus, you won't be able to rocket jump to escape, so you'll have to make the most of the class through team utility.\
\
This will come in the form of team-wide buffs that are situational but very strong if timed correctly. His Buff Banner can provide mini-crits to deal more damage and, consequently, more knockback. His Battallion's Backup can provide damage resistance to protect against some sources of damage. Finally, his Concheror, one of the best utilities in the game, can provide speed boosts and health regen upon damaging zombies. All this allows him to juggle between being a supportive defender, staller, or retreater depending on what best fits the situation. One thing to note about Soldier banners is that all of his **primaries have damage fall-off based at range!** This means you'll be building <mark style="color:red;">**less banner**</mark> per hit the further zombies away from you are.\
\
If you want to utilize his rockets, you will have to be careful with how you fire them to avoid accidentally "boosting" zombies into positions that will kill your team. It's crucial that you try to hit a zombie directly rather than go for splash damage to mitigate these issues. The Liberty Launcher and Direct Hit can help with this. Although, in some scenarios, it may be helpful to launch zombies if it's off of edges or thin platforms. There really should not be more than 2 or 3 soldiers in a team to avoid boosting altogether, _which is ironic given that Soldier is the class automatically chosen on joining the server._
