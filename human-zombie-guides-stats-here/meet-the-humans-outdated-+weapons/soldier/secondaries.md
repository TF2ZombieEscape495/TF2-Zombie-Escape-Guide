Welcome to the only reason why you should ever play Soldier. Effectively a Mad Milk and Bonk! with a much longer duration, Concheror gives your a team a speed buff and life steal when activated. The life steal quickly outheals any Mutation damage from Medic zombies or Pyro zombies for your defenders while the speed boost is fantastic for your slow classes on fallbacks, giving your Pyros more speed to avoid Heavy enzymes while defending, and equalizing the speed difference that Scout Mutations cause between the zombies and humans. Remember that the buff lasts for <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[15] seconds**</mark> and it takes <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[3 seconds]**</mark> to activate it as you typically want to use this during fallbacks so everyone is safe. Be mindful that your conch doesn't run out in the middle of a fallback if you're using your conch while defending! **Be especially mindful that you don't use your Conch during parkour sections, as that's a good way to piss off your team and result in getting slayed or banned for griefing.**

Essentially giving you and your team a second life, the Battalion's Backup gives a defense buff that prevents the zombies from one-shotting you while also reducing damage from NPCs and bosses. However, this effect sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Some NPC/boss damage will still do the full amount, while some zombies can still one-shot full-HP survivors under its effects. It also greatly overlaps with the Medic's primary role of preventing your team from being killed through overhealing though on some bosses that remove healing, the Backup could be better for saving your team! However, that shouldn't deter you from using this weapon as, when it does work, it allows you to save humans, which is more than enough than what is expected from a weapon. Don't forget that it comes with a +20 HP bonus, letting you survive most zombie melees!

Giving your team an offensive buff of minicrits, the Buff Banner lets your team inflict more knockback and damage. However, this effect doesn't have as much impact as one might think. The issue is that it's at its strongest when there are a lot of defending teammates to buff. But if there are a lot of defending teammates already, they could more than likely hold without it. When you're down to a few humans, you wish you were a stronger defending class as the minicrits you grant on your teammates do not make up for Soldier's poor defending abilities. The Buff Banner can still be a decent choice regardless of those scenarios, as they allow your other defenders to excel at their jobs even more.

The Reserve Shooter in base TF2 is a shotgun primarily utilized as a follow-up weapon for enemy players launched in the air. With its faster deploy time and ability to mini-crit airborne targets, it can more easily take them down. Since a majority of the time, the goal is to simply shoot at zombies with ludicrous amounts of HP, this mechanic doesn’t really play much of a role.&#x20;

What can instead be taken advantage of is its 20% faster deployment time, allowing players to respond to immediate threats much more easily. From there, this weapon has been remade to accentuate accuracy among the shotguns much like how a player would need to accurately shoot enemy players launched in the air. **The difference in DPS compared to the stock Shotgun is practically negligible.**

The goal of these attributes is to provide a higher-accuracy hitscan weapon for the Pyro and Soldier. They reduce the weapon's horde-stoppability while making it great for fighting bosses or NPCs that are far away or fast-moving. To an extent, this can make it less effective for fallbacks with larger hordes but greater for single-target stalling. The smaller clip size and higher accuracy may be a bit more perilous for Pyros defending up close and for Soldiers boosting zombies in front of them. In a pinch, the faster deployment time can help, but, in the heat of the moment, the smaller clip size and lesser spread may prove fatal.

The stock shotgun is pretty much the de facto weapon used by new players or those overwhelmed by all the weapon changes. It also sets the precedent for pretty much all shotgun-esque weapons. This weapon's base DPS is around \~150, which is a damage range all weapons will hover around with a lowered fire rate to compensate.

The stock Shotgun _does_ cover some of Soldier's weaknesses, such as unreliable defending and low DPS. However, if you're using this, why are you even playing Soldier? The other shotgun-wielding classes, Pyro, Heavy, and Engineer, defend and provide much **more utility than Soldier if he's without his banners.**

The Panic Attack in base TF2 has gone through many revisions. It was originally a charged burst weapon that fired much faster the lower one’s health was. Now, it’s a rapid-fire burst weapon that loses accuracy the longer one keeps firing. These modifications follow the trend of the latter, as this weapon has been reworked into an immediate response option for players caught out by groups of zombies.

Currently the weapon stands as the **fastest-firing yet slowest-reloading** shotgun. With a TEC time of 2.43 seconds and a FRT of 5.4 seconds, this produces an extremely low uptime-downtime ratio of 0.45. This means that this weapon is **highly unsustainable for long-term defenses** and should only be used if necessary. This weapon has a 37% damage penalty, leading to the lowest sustained DPS among all shotguns at \~130. But, because this weapon boasts an extremely high fire rate, its nonstop DPS is actually **one of the highest among all weapons at 420 **_**(provided that you have an**_ [_**ammo item.**_](../../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md#human-items)_**)**_

Even if this weapon has low sustained DPS, it evens out by being given a damage bonus to players in an attempt to make it more effective for close-range knockback in hitting multiple zombies due to the spread 'penalty' applying to extra pellets. With all this in effect, hopefully this becomes a weapon Pyros, Heavies, and Soldiers can consider as an option should they tend to over-defend or get caught out often. The low damage and high spread also make this weapon less appealing for fast-moving boss fights, so try to _avoid_ using it on maps that require optimal DPS or accurate shots to win unless you're comfortable with getting up close.

The Righteous Bison in base TF2 is an interesting secondary for Soldier that deviates from the usual hitscan shotguns. Its projectiles can be duds under certain conditions, and they tend to be very underwhelming in heated fights. However, that doesn't impede people's enjoyment of penetrating players as they hear their hitsounds bang out in quick succession.&#x20;

In Zombie Escape, this feeling can be intensified to a far greater extent as enemy players tend to approach slower than in base TF2 and can find themselves clustered and stacked on top of each other for ease of piercing. To make it even more impressive of a tool to be used on zombies, it has been tweaked with a clip size of 8, a 50% faster fire rate, a 25% faster reload time, and a +130% damage bonus to players. You can now suppress for longer, fire out shots faster, and make bigger impacts. **Just know that because this shoots out bursts of energy, this still makes it absolutely useless for most boss fights.**
