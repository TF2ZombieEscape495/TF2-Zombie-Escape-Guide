Welcome to the only reason why you should ever play Soldier. Effectively a Mad Milk and Bonk! with a much longer duration, Concheror gives your a team a speed buff and life steal when activated. The life steal quickly outheals any Mutation damage from Medic zombies or Pyro zombies for your defenders while the speed boost is fantastic for your slow classes on fallbacks, giving your Pyros more speed to avoid Heavy enzymes while defending, and equalizing the speed difference that Scout Mutations cause between the zombies and humans. Remember that the buff lasts for <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[15] seconds**</mark> and it takes <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[3 seconds]**</mark> to activate it as you typically want to use this during fallbacks so everyone is safe. Be mindful that your conch doesn't run out in the middle of a fallback if you're using your conch while defending! **Be especially mindful that you don't use your Conch during parkour sections, as that's a good way to piss off your team and result in getting slayed or banned for griefing.**

Essentially giving you and your team a second life, the Battalion's Backup gives a defense buff that prevents the zombies from one-shotting you while also reducing damage from NPCs and bosses. However, this effect sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Some NPC/boss damage will still do the full amount, while some zombies can still one-shot full-HP survivors under its effects. It also greatly overlaps with the Medic's primary role of preventing your team from being killed through overhealing though on some bosses that remove healing, the Backup could be better for saving your team! However, that shouldn't deter you from using this weapon as, when it does work, it allows you to save humans, which is more than enough than what is expected from a weapon. Don't forget that it comes with a +20 HP bonus, letting you survive most zombie melees!

Giving your team an offensive buff of minicrits, the Buff Banner lets your team inflict more knockback and damage. However, this effect doesn't have as much impact as one might think. The issue is that it's at its strongest when there are a lot of defending teammates to buff. But if there are a lot of defending teammates already, they could more than likely hold without it. When you're down to a few humans, you wish you were a stronger defending class as the minicrits you grant on your teammates do not make up for Soldier's poor defending abilities. The Buff Banner can still be a decent choice regardless of those scenarios, as they allow your other defenders to excel at their jobs even more.

The Reserve Shooter exhibits two features of the new shotguns: increased damage and lesser firing speed. The main aspect of this shotgun in particular is the increased accuracy - giving a feel much akin to something like the frontier justice in terms of singling out particular zombies and not having the same spread of multi-coverage; (which your rockets will in most cases cover via splash damage) - a good go-to for when a map requires a DPS check for both Pyro and Soldier. Another downside worth noting is you'll have six less shots than stock.

The stock Shotgun covers some of Soldier's weaknesses, such as unreliable defending and low DPS. However, if you're using this, why are you even playing Soldier? The other shotgun-wielding classes, Pyro, Heavy, and Engineer, defend and provide much more utility than Soldier if he's without his banners.

An alternative option for the shotgun that can _also_ be used by Pyro, Heavy, and Engineer - This one succeeds well in providing a very short burst of cover for moments where zombies are right behind you and you need them off your tail. The extra deploy speed is going to help with that a lot. Basically a mini-minigun condensed into a secondary but you will have to spend downtime reloading. Not exactly good for prolonged periods of delaying due to its accuracy falloff, but also has the niche wherein if a map has an [**ammo item**](../../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md) you can activate that and absolutely shred down a boss with the insanely high firerate from using one of said infinite ammo powerups.

An alternative to the shotgun that will pack _slightly more_ damage over stock does; almost effectively a reskin with a **lower clip;** the 6 missing clip shots will definitely go noticed when you need it most for defenses - but if the deploy speed is desirable and panic isn't favorable, then it's an okay pick for that.

Unfortunately, this isn't like the Short Circuit where it slows the zombies for a long time, providing great fallback potential. It doesn't even knock them back or damage NPCs or bosses!
