Lowest damage, slow firing speed, slower reload time, why is the Liberty Launcher even considered good? One simple reason, the Liberty Launcher essentially has one point of Rocket Specialist from MvM. Although rockets already knockback and AoE slow, none of them are able to completely halt a zombie and stop them in their tracks. **This is very important against the most dangerous zombie, the Heavy.** Being able to take no knockback when using their Mutation, the Heavy Zombie could easily kill a defender especially on certain tight chokepoints. There is no other rocket launcher that halts the Heavy from moving when they use their Mutation _except_ the Liberty Launcher. So use this to completely stop them them in their tracks and prevent those sweaty zombie Heavies from killing your team!

## Cow Mangler 5000   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Cow\_Mangler\_5000 (1).png>)

| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: A charged shot that mini-crits players, sets them on fire and disables buildings for 4 sec**</mark> | **Real DPS** - 134 DPS          |

Sacrificing the utility of the Liberty Launcher, the Cow Mangler allows Soldier to obtain rage for his banners much quicker by allowing him to shoot rockets more often with less downtime thanks to its much quicker reload time. His secondary fire can be helpful to obtain rage from faraway zombies thanks to minicrits being unaffected by range. Just remember to use those rockets to defend properly and charge your banners rather than boost the zombies towards your team as this weapon can easily launch zombies!

## Black Box   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Black\_Box (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                                               | Damage                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 4 Shots                                                                      | Clip DPS - 155.555 DPS          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+40% Damage Bonus**</mark>                                   | Base Damage - 126 per shot      |

| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Faster Reload Time**</mark>                             | TEC - 3.24 seconds              |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Damage vs Players**</mark>                               | Reload Time (F) - 0.69 seconds  |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Hit: Gain up to +20 health per attack**</mark>          | Reload Time (C) - 0.6 seconds   |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Gains a damage bonus as rage increases, up to 40%**</mark> | Full Reload Time - 2.49 seconds |
|                                                                                          | **Real DPS** - 87.9 DPS         |

The black box loses 2 rockets over stock for its vanilla self-healing attribute, but that's not what's important here - the downside of losing two rockets is negligible since you're always constantly reloading to shoot zombies. The main draw of this weapon is its role in support of having double banner length - effectively turning all your <mark style="color:yellow;">\~</mark>_<mark style="color:yellow;">15 second banners</mark>_ _**into**_ _<mark style="color:yellow;">**\~30 second banners;**</mark>_ at the cost of being **harder to build banner** from zombies unless at close range (risk of being heavy enzymed, killed by an item etc.) It's pretty solid at keeping a consistent choice of banner up for longer defenses like stalling, but shares Liberty's problem of having _very_ mediocre DPS.

## Direct Hit   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Direct\_Hit (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                | Damage                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 4 Shots                                                       | Clip DPS - 301.5 DPS            |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+235% Damage Bonus**</mark>                   | Base Damage - 301 per shot      |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Projectile Speed**</mark>               | Attack Interval - 0.81          |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-85% Explosion Radius**</mark>                 | TEC - 3.24 seconds              |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25% Slower Reload Time**</mark>               | Reload Time (F) - 0.69 seconds  |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Damage vs Players**</mark>                | Reload Time (C) - 0.6 seconds   |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25 Max Health on Wearer**</mark>              | Full Reload Time - 2.49 seconds |
|  <mark style="color:orange;">**Applies -800 z velocity on damage**</mark> | **Real DPS** - 210.471 DPS      |

The Direct Hit greatly reduces one of Soldier's issues: boosting the zombies unexpectedly. Due to the lower explosion radius and much quicker projectile speed, you're more able to accurately push the zombies in the direction you want them to go. The smaller explosion radius does, however, reduce the amount of zombies slowed in a horde and makes charging banners a bit slower. Although it has the highest DPS out of all the Soldier primaries.

Being able to barrage a group of zombies with several rockets, the Air Strike has the ability to rain rockets down upon a horde. Although this may be effective in trying to boost zombies off a small platform, the fast fire rate can be counterproductive for slowing zombies with explosives. You typically want to space out your shots, with a long enough interval to slow again after the previously applied slowness wears off. These effects don't stack, so launching a bunch of rockets in quick succession will greatly reduce the overall time zombies are slowed for. It also doesn't account for the fact that the zombies could easily be launched at your team by doing so!

Yep, rocket jumper's enabled - but it still <mark style="color:red;">**does not allow you to blast jump in any capacity**</mark><mark style="color:red;">** **</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">**(as intended)**</mark>_ - only difference between this and stock (below) is that with this option you can't blow yourself up with it; so you have a little HP reduction as a trade-off.

The Rocket Launcher is sadly just outclassed by the Cow Mangler 5000. The much faster reload greatly surpasses the higher clip that the Rocket Launcher provides and none of the downsides that the Mangler has really matter that much, such as the firing speed penalty as you're still able to effectively slow the zombies down as long as possible with the Cow Mangler.
