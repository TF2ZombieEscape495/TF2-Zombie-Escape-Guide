## Bonk! Atomic Punch   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Bonk!\_Atomic\_Punch (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Drink to become invulnerable for 8 seconds.**</mark>                       |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Cannot attack during this time.**</mark>                                   |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Damage absorbed will slow you when the effect ends.**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Grants speed boost (\~126%) to all nearby teammates for 8 seconds**</mark> |
|  <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cooldown is 30 seconds**</mark>                                           |

Arguably Scout's most useful secondary, Bonk! Atomic Punch allows you to boost yourself and your team for <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[8 seconds.]**</mark> Speed buffs are one of the most useful buffs you can give. Bonk! is extremely helpful on fallbacks, helping slower classes safely retreat and avoid getting caught in TPs. While you can somewhat bodyblock zombies with your invulnerability, zombies can easily knock you away with their melee. You can use the invulnerability to potentially survive timed teleports or even clutch solo wins if timed right. **Be especially mindful that you don't use your Bonk! during parkour sections, as that's a good way to piss off your team and result in getting slayed or banned for griefing.**

## Mad Milk    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Mad\_Milk.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25 max health on wearer**</mark>                                                                              |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Extinguishing teammates reduces cooldown by -20%**</mark>                                                    |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Players heal 60% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk. Can be used to extinguish fires.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Base Cooldown is 20 seconds**</mark>                                                                         |

Easily able to save yourself or other people, Mad Milk is a situational utility that allows Humans to heal upon shooting milked zombies. Typically, a team should have Medics, Soldiers, and/or Engineers to provide healing, but things don't always end up going as planned. They might all be dead or not even be picked in the first place! Zombies will capitalize on this by chaining Pyro Mutations to whittle the team's HP down. Mad Milk can easily prevent this from happening and prevent humans from dying from all the Mutation damage. Did I forget to mention that it gives you <mark style="color:green;">**+25 hp**</mark>, allowing you to tank a normal zombie hit and save your life?



## Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Pretty\_Boy's\_Pocket\_Pistol (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                  | Damage                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 54 Shots                                                                        | Clip DPS - 180.952 DPS          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% Damage Bonus**</mark>                                      | Base Damage - 19 per shot       |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% Faster Firing Speed**</mark>                               | Attack Interval - 0.104         |
| <mark style="color:red;">-</mark><mark style="color:red;">**47% Slower Reload Time**</mark> | TEC - 5.670 seconds             |
|                                                                                             | Full Reload Time- 0.583 seconds |
|                                                                                             | **Real DPS** - 142 DPS          |

A bit more of a selfish way of getting healing, the Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol is a near identical copy of the stock Pistol but with the downside of having a smaller clip and the situational upside of healing on hit. NPCs and bosses do not trigger its On Hit effects, and healing is usually plentiful and unneeded when doorhugging. You could use it in situations where you wish to be a more independent Scout with the BFB or in boss fights where you _can_ shoot the zombies and healing isn't nerfed. Or pair it with the Force-A-Nature since you'll be taking a lot more total damage with that equipped.

## Winger    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Winger (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                        | Damage                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 36 Shots                                              | Clip DPS - 180.953 DPS           |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% Damage Bonus**</mark>            | Base Damage - 19 per shot        |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% Faster Firing Speed**</mark>     | Attack Interval - 0.105          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+10% Faster Reload Time**</mark>      | TEC - 3.78 seconds               |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Disabled Extra Jump Height**</mark> | Full Reload Time - 0.945 seconds |
|                                                                   | **Real DPS** - 144 DPS           |

_At one point_ the Winger would give no fall damage, but that attribute was moved onto BFB for a better drawback; now currently the utility niche of the Winger is that it provides a quicker reload downtime against the other pistol picks - but does have the smallest clip and lowest damage of the Scout pistol trio, so using it to repeatedly reload and single out zombies for stalling might be the best way to put it to work.

## Pistol    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Pistol (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                    | Damages                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 72 shots                                          | Clip DPS - 180.952 DPS          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% damage bonus**</mark>        | Base Damage - 20 per shot       |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% faster firing speed**</mark> | Attack Interval - 0.105         |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-47% slower reload time**</mark>   | TEC - 7.560 seconds             |
|                                                               | Full Reload Time- 0.583 seconds |
|                                                               | **Real DPS** - 150 DPS          |

An alternative to the other picks, the stock Pistol is a reliable substitute if you need a secondary for raw firepower. The stock Pistol is best paired with something that can barely pack a punch like the BFB, especially for the NPCs and/or bosses that you have to shoot down; especially if they're bullet-based counters. Since you'll mainly be doorhugging even on maps with these elements, the boosted stats won't play as large a role as one might think. Mostly comes down to your preference on clip size or utility.

## Crit-a-Cola    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Crit-a-Cola (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Holster Speed**</mark>                                                                     |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Deploy Speed**</mark>                                                                      |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+70% Recharge Rate**</mark>                                                                      |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**While effect is active: each attack mini-crits and sets Mark-For-Death for 8 seconds.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cooldown is 15.4 seconds**</mark>                                                              |

One would think that the Crit-a-Cola would give AoE crits to your team, similar to how Bonk! Atomic Punch gives an AoE speed boost. The solo minicrits will only slightly even bolster Scout's knockback potential - also can deploy it very quickly.

## Flying Guillotine    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Flying\_Guillotine (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Mark for death on hit for 15 seconds, one target at a time**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Damage Bonus (111 on hit, 11 per bleed)**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Long distance hits reduce recharge time**</mark>                   |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Base Cooldown is 5 Seconds**</mark>                                |

The Flying Gulilotine is a projectile that can deal 90 damage to a zombie with 20k HP while slightly annoying them with a small push every 4.5 seconds. You can mildly annoy one singular zombie with a bleed, but if you really want to bully one particular zombie, you should just go Sniper instead.
