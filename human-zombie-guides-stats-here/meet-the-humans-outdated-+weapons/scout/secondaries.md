## Bonk! Atomic Punch   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Bonk!\_Atomic\_Punch (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Drink to become invulnerable for 8 seconds.**</mark>                       |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Cannot attack during this time.**</mark>                                   |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Damage absorbed will slow you when the effect ends.**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Grants speed boost (\~126%) to all nearby teammates for 8 seconds**</mark> |
|  <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cooldown is 30 seconds**</mark>                                           |

Arguably Scout's most useful secondary, Bonk! Atomic Punch allows you to boost yourself and your team for <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[8 seconds.]**</mark> Speed buffs are one of the most useful buffs you can give. Bonk! is extremely helpful on fallbacks, helping slower classes safely retreat and avoid getting caught in TPs. While you can somewhat bodyblock zombies with your invulnerability, zombies can easily knock you away with their melee. You can use the invulnerability to potentially survive timed teleports or even clutch solo wins if timed right. **Be especially mindful that you don't use your Bonk! during parkour sections, as that's a good way to piss off your team and result in getting slayed or banned for griefing.**

## Mad Milk    ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Mad\_Milk.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25 max health on wearer**</mark>                                                                              |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Extinguishing teammates reduces cooldown by -20%**</mark>                                                    |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Players heal 60% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk. Can be used to extinguish fires.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Base Cooldown is 20 seconds**</mark>                                                                         |

Easily able to save yourself or other people, Mad Milk is a situational utility that allows Humans to heal upon shooting milked zombies. Typically, a team should have Medics, Soldiers, and/or Engineers to provide healing, but things don't always end up going as planned. They might all be dead or not even be picked in the first place! Zombies will capitalize on this by chaining Pyro Mutations to whittle the team's HP down. Mad Milk can easily prevent this from happening and prevent humans from dying from all the Mutation damage. Did I forget to mention that it gives you <mark style="color:green;">**+25 hp**</mark>, allowing you to tank a normal zombie hit and save your life?

## Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Pretty\_Boy's\_Pocket\_Pistol (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                            |

| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Hit: Gain up to +3.0 health**</mark> |

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><mark style="color:purple;"><strong>[Timings]</strong></mark></td><td>Attack Interval: 0.09</td><td>TEC: 3.24 seconds</td><td>Full Reload Time: 1.515 seconds</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:purple;"><strong>Damage [Func_Physbox]</strong></mark></td><td>Base Damage: 17.25 per shot</td><td><strong>Real DPS:</strong> 130.598 DPS</td><td>Clip DPS <em>(Nonstop)</em>: 191.666 DPS</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:purple;"><strong>Damage [Func_Breakable]</strong></mark></td><td>Base Damage: 8 per shot</td><td><strong>Real DPS:</strong> 60.567 DPS</td><td>Clip DPS <em>(Nonstop)</em>: 88.888 DPS</td></tr></tbody></table>

The Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol acts as the fastest firing secondary among all Scout pistols; added with the situational upside of healing on hit. NPCs and Bosses **do not** trigger its On Hit effects, and healing is usually plentiful and unneeded when doorhugging. With an infinite ammo item, it can reach the potential of miniguns with 11.111 nonstop BPS _(Bullets Per Second)_ but will still remain strong without it at 7.57 sustained BPS. You could use it in situations where you wish to be a more independent Scout with the BFB or in boss fights where you _can_ shoot the zombies and healing isn't nerfed.

## Winger    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Winger (1).png>)

The Winger is the more damaging variant among all the Pistols at the cost of clip size in base TF2. It also has a unique +25% jump height bonus, but it’s been **removed** in Zombie Escape to avoid exploiting most maps.&#x20;

In consolation, it’s been given a +25% faster weapon switch and a smaller bullet spread at 80:1. This is in the hopes of making it a faster and more effective response option as a weapon for single-target stalling or for fighting certain bosses. You can get up close with the pistol to stall and quickly swap to scatterguns if surrounded or vice versa when dealing with bosses that tend to run away. Currently this pistol fits also the niche of hitting the hardest (\~150 DPS) among the other two at cost of its low clip - but you can holster it quicker if caught out during its _many_ downtimes.

The Pistol serves as Scout and Engineer’s trusty follow-up weapon the majority of the time. In base TF2, if enemies are far away or low on health, they can quickly swap to this weapon in the hopes of more accurately putting a few shots in. It’s not meant to be stronger than a Shotgun, hence the damage nerf of \~140 DPS.

What this weapon does now excel at is accuracy, which is emphasized by its decreased bullet spread to 100:1. This makes the Pistol one of the better picks for single-target stalling and for shooting at fast-moving or far-away bosses, assuming one can track well.

## Crit-a-Cola    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Crit-a-Cola (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Holster Speed**</mark>                                                                     |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Deploy Speed**</mark>                                                                      |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+70% Recharge Rate**</mark>                                                                      |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**While effect is active: each attack mini-crits and sets Mark-For-Death for 8 seconds.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cooldown is 15.4 seconds**</mark>                                                              |

One would think that the Crit-a-Cola would give AoE crits to your team, similar to how Bonk! Atomic Punch gives an AoE speed boost. The solo minicrits will only slightly even bolster Scout's knockback potential - also can deploy it very quickly.

## Flying Guillotine    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Flying\_Guillotine (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**Mark for death on hit for 15 seconds, one target at a time**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+100% Damage Bonus (111 on hit, 11 per bleed)**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Long distance hits reduce recharge time**</mark>                   |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Base Cooldown is 5 Seconds**</mark>                                |

The Flying Gulilotine is a projectile that can deal 90 damage to a zombie with 20k HP while slightly annoying them with a small push every 4.5 seconds. You can mildly annoy one singular zombie with a bleed, but if you really want to bully one particular zombie, you should just go Sniper instead.
