# Scout Melees

## Fan O' War   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Fan\_O'War.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-75% Damage Penalty**</mark>                                                                             |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit**</mark>                                                   |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death, causing all damage taken to be mini-crits.**</mark> |

The Fan O'War is technically Scout's best melee weapon, even though it really doesn't do anything extraordinary comparatively. The only practical benefit of this item is applying the Marked For Death debuff on a Heavy using their Mutation when you melee them, don't actually kill them, and need someone to shoot them for cleanup.

## Atomizer   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Atomizer (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-100% Slower Swing Speed**</mark>                          |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-15% Damage vs Players**</mark>                            |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +3% Speed Boost (301 hu/s scaled maps**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: -3 HP Degenerated per Second**</mark>           |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Melee attacks mini-crit while airborne.**</mark>        |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Does not grant an extra jump while deployed**</mark>    |

The triple jump ability is removed for the atomizer, and double jumping is disabled in most cases anyway. Currently rather than the base TF2 niche of giving verticality; you instead gain more mobility when its held out - letting you beat other classes (or other base weapon scouts) to items quicker, at the cost of almost being down a melee due, _(and losing health until its holstered.)_ <mark style="color:red;">**HP degen prevents this weapon being stacked with Baby Faces Blaster.**</mark>

## Bat   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Bat.png)![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Holy\_Mackerel.png)

#### ~~`fish better, noob`~~

_Same as vanilla bat, pan, anything of the sort, no special attributes or stats._ Good pick if you don't want to rock any gimmicky stats and just want a solid melee to take out heavy enzymes.

## Sun-on-a-stick   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Sun-on-a-Stick.png)

| Attributes                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-Deals no damage to Zombies.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+20% Universal Switch Speed**</mark> |

Currently the sun-on-a-stick is a support weapon that does exactly as its attributes imply - giving you a quicker secondary or primary switch, _(and should stack for any Scout weapons that already have those attributes.)_ <mark style="color:red;">**at the significant cost of being down a melee entirely.**</mark>

## Candy Cane   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Candy\_Cane (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50 HP on hit**</mark>                                                                          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: Up to**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**+3 HP/s regen**</mark>                    |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: Marked for death (remains for a short period of time when switching weapons)**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Kill: A small health pack is dropped**</mark>                                              |

With this, you can build any lost HP back by smacking zombies (probably heavies as per usual.) On melee kill with the Candy Cane, zombies will drop a small health kit. Since health packs dropped will usually be surrounded by other zombies, it could be very detrimental as low zombies may pick them up to gain back 20.5% of their hp. If you're trying to solo, the health kit won't matter as you are unable to heal with it.

## Boston Basher   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Boston\_Basher (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25% damage penalty**</mark>             |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Miss: Unable to hit self!**</mark> |

While you might think that the downside can help build Übers, ÜberCharge in this mode can be niche and gained relatively fast regardless. The self-hit attribute is removed to eliminate any possibility of self-damage jumps causing map exploits - otherwise the damage penalty brings it to a subpar pick against the ones above.

## Sandman   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Sandman.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+40% slow for 3 seconds on hit**</mark>                                                   |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+2 max balls (3 total balls, each recharges one after another, not all at once)**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-100% Slower Swing Speed**</mark>                                                          |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-15 Max Health On Wearer**</mark>                                                          |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: Launches a ball that slows opponents**</mark>                                 |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**\~10 Second Cooldown**</mark>                                                           |

Currently the sandman is capable of launching (3) slow inflicting projectiles; something that can be done by just...shooting a zombie - _but_ a -40% slow (with accurate hits) can at least shut down a Heavy Enzyme pre-emptively or any Zombie Item users that are trying to close in on you or your teammates. With the cooldown time, you'll be spending upwards of \~30 seconds to build back all 3 balls, while zombies can build their enzymes in at least \~10 seconds of being shot at.

## Wrap Assassin   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Wrap\_Assassin (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Recharge Rate**</mark>                                                                |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+40% slow for 1.5 seconds on hit (Extends the target that bleeds to 6.5 seconds)**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+1 max ball (2 total balls, each recharges one after another, not all at once)**</mark>    |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held:**</mark> <mark style="color:red;">**-3% Slower Move Speed**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-100% Slower Swing Speed**</mark>                                                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-75% Damage Penalty**</mark>                                                                |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: Launches a festive ornament that shatters causing bleed**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**\~15 second cooldown**</mark>                                                            |

The Wrap Assassin allows Scout two zombies down with his ball from midrange. Zombies, when they take damage, are slowed down a bit so the Wrap Assassin can work as a really bootleg sandman - but the bleed damage is kind of nothing to sail about as Zombies aren't going to bleed out with upwards of 20K+ HP.
