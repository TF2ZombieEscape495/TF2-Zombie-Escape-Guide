## Fan O' War   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Fan\_O'War.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-75% damage penalty**</mark>                                                                             |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit**</mark>                                                   |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death, causing all damage taken to be mini-crits.**</mark> |

The Fan O'War is technically Scout's best melee weapon, even though it really doesn't do anything extraordinary comparatively. The only practical benefit of this item is applying the Marked For Death debuff on a Heavy using their Mutation when you melee them, don't actually kill them, and need someone to shoot them for cleanup.

## Sun-on-a-stick   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Sun-on-a-Stick.png)

| Attributes                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**100% critical hit vs burning players**</mark>     |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% fire damage resistance while deployed**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25% damage penalty**</mark>                         |

The Sun-on-a-Stick lets you reduce the effects of afterburn from Pyro mutations, but is practically useless with sources of healing being plentiful and the Scout having two ways of dealing with afterburn. Although, you could one-shot a Heavy using their Mutation so long as they are on fire because crits do affect the damage of meleeing an enzymed heavy. These are extremely specific examples, but at least they're something.

## Bat   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Bat.png)![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Holy\_Mackerel.png)

#### ~~`fish better, noob`~~

_Same as vanilla bat, pan, anything of the sort, no special attributes or stats._ Good pick if you don't want to rock any gimmicky stats and just want a solid melee to take out heavy enzymes.

## Wrap Assassin   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Wrap\_Assassin (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% increase in recharge rate**</mark>                                                    |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+40% slow for 1.5 seconds on hit (Extends the target that bleeds to 6.5 seconds)**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+1 max ball (2 total balls, each recharges one after another, not all at once)**</mark>    |
| <mark style="color:red;">**100% slower swing speed**</mark>                                                            |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-75% damage penalty**</mark>                                                                |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: Launches a festive ornament that shatters causing bleed**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**\~60 second cooldown**</mark>                                                            |

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Pending description rework:**</mark> The Wrap Assassin allows Scout to slow one, singular zombie down with his ball from midrange. Zombies, when they take damage, are slowed down a bit so the Wrap Assassin can work as a really bootleg sandman. It has no downside other than when you're Last Man Standing, which is why it's rated here even if the upside is essentially very little.

## Boston Basher   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Boston\_Basher (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25% damage penalty**</mark>             |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Miss: Unable to hit self!**</mark> |

While you might think that the downside can help build Übers, ÜberCharge in this mode can be niche and gained relatively fast regardless. The self-hit attribute is removed to eliminate any possibility of self-damage jumps causing map exploits - otherwise the damage penalty brings it to a subpar pick against the ones above.

## Candy Cane   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Candy\_Cane (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50 HP on hit**</mark>                                                                          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: Up to**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**+3 HP/s regen**</mark>                    |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: Marked for death (remains for a short period of time when switching weapons)**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Kill: A small health pack is dropped**</mark>                                              |

With this, you can build any lost HP back by smacking zombies (probably heavies as per usual.) On melee kill with the Candy Cane, zombies will drop a small health kit. Since health packs dropped will usually be surrounded by other zombies, it could be very detrimental as low zombies may pick them up to gain back 20.5% of their hp. If you're trying to solo, the health kit won't matter as you are unable to heal with it.

## Atomizer   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Atomizer (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-15% damage vs players**</mark>                         |
| <mark style="color:red;">**This weapon deploys 50% slower**</mark>                 |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Melee attacks mini-crit while airborne.**</mark>     |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Does not grant an extra jump while deployed**</mark> |

The triple jump ability is removed for the atomizer, and double jumping is disabled in most cases anyway. Thus, you'll have to worry about the penalties instead.

## Sandman   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Sandman.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+40% slow for 3 seconds on hit**</mark>                                                   |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+2 max balls (3 total balls, each recharges one after another, not all at once)**</mark>  |
| <mark style="color:red;">**100% slower swing speed**</mark>                                                           |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-15 max health on wearer**</mark>                                                          |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: Launches a ball that slows opponents**</mark>                                 |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**\~30 Second Cooldown**</mark>                                                           |

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Pending description rework:**</mark> While the Sandman does seem like the weapon with the most relevant upside, you have to realize that shooting a zombie with your primary accomplishes the same thing of slowing them down. Sure, -15 HP out of 200 doesn't really do anything, but it's the most relevant downside of all the melees.
