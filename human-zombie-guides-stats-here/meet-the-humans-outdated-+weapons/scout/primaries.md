The Scattergun is probably the Scout's most reliable primary weapon in base TF2. While it doesn't have many gimmicks, it excels at its job of high damage rewarded by proper aim and positioning. In Zombie Escape, these changes intend to solidify this idea of being a reliable default option for new and experienced players alike. To do so, it shares similar stats to the modified Shotgun, albeit slightly better in some cases. With a fairly higher sustained DPS compared to other weapons (\~170); the Scattergun serves as a great all-rounder for players unconcerned about specific playstyles or mechanics.

The Force-A-Nature in base TF2 is a renowned weapon for its extremely fast shots and the “punchy” feeling it gives off. Added onto this is a knockback effect that impacts both the targeted player and the user, allowing the latter an additional “jump” in the air. Unfortunately, this knockback effect has been disabled or altered in Zombie Escape such that it **cannot be used** to one’s advantage. So, rather than attempt to work into that, these attributes aim to intensify the feeling of having an explosive, rapid-fire shotgun that lends itself well to defenses at a cost.

Pushing more into the explosive aspect defensive support does come with a cost; this weapon has been modified to be -100% less accurate, with an added flare of successive shots becoming less accurate. You will not hit anything unless you’re up close. The spread can help at a reasonable distance for hitting wider groups of zombies, but for boss fights, this makes the weapon somewhat unreliable to use at times. **You will need to be up close in front of bosses** to land all pellets to take advantage of this weapon's particularly high DPS, which can be dangerous since you’ll also be moving a bit slower _(At a Pyro, Enginer, or Sniper's movement speed when held out.)_

It’s a bit of a high-commitment weapon that encourages Scouts to be up close to push zombies back and dish out massive damage. Compared to the other scatterguns, this offers burst damage to bosses that get too close and serves as an emergency response to defenses about to be lost.\

Playing into Scout's niche, the Baby Face's Blaster allows him to push way past his base speed. This allows him to get triggers even faster, at the cost of his high DPS. Do be mindful of maps with NPCs, bosses, or map hazards that damage you. **It only takes 25 damage to bring your boost down from 100 to 0 and you'll be left slowed down if there are no zombies to shoot at to regain your boost.** The little bit of accuracy it has can help mitigate that by hitting zombies with it from afar. Some of the best secondaries to pair with the BFB are Bonk! Atomic Punch or any of the pistols. Use the Bonk! Atomic Punch with maximum BFB boost to move _even faster_, or the Winger to compensate for the BFB's low DPS. Fall damage is no longer a worry either with this equipped, so this should let you easily grab triggers on maps that have it enabled!

The Shortstop is a bit of a weird weapon that has gone through many revisions in base TF2. Focusing on the idea of potentially being a good alternative to the Scattergun, this weapon emphasizes the idea of greater accuracy and fire rate at the cost of damage. The Shortstop has a tighter spread than the Scattergun at 50:1 compared to its 30:1, but also fewer bullets per shot and the ability to reload its entire clip at once.

These attributes make it something to consider in situations where players may need to accurately shoot down targets; it could be utilized well for single-target stalling against zombies, fast-moving bosses with smaller hitboxes, or far-away DPS checks. Pistols can, of course, serve this same purpose, but Scouts may want to consider this weapon if running support items like the Mad Milk or Bonk! Atomic Punch.

The Soda Popper in base TF2 is an interesting weapon for its Hype mechanic. After dealing enough damage, you can generate a Hype meter to gain multiple extra jumps for ridiculous mobility while fighting enemies. Of course, **this mobility would be extremely overpowered or break entire sections of maps, so it has been disabled.** _Instead_, these changes sort of call back to the Soda Popper’s old mechanic relating to mini-crits by instead buffing them.

To fit in with the Crit-a-Cola design, the Soda Popper is a synergistic weapon that **transforms minicrits into full crits** with falloff. Even with the falloff, this makes it more effective at knocking back players from a distance. This also makes exterior sources of mini-crits even more powerful and weapons that you can equip to grant yourself mini-crits even more useful. This unique gimmick _does_ come at the cost of the weapon’s DPS.

With making use of its wide bullet spread; players might find themselves weaving in and out of a defense. To begin the chain of crits, players may push in to look for targets low on HP and pull out to carry out a stall at a safer distance with crits. There is also an interesting interplay with Sniper and Spy, as these are the classes expected to kill off zombies. If they so choose, they can leave zombies with low enough health values for Soda Popper Scouts to finish off. They sacrifice the kill on their end to potentially buff the defense if you can use your weapon effectively. Or a Soldier's Buff banner can leave you with crits for the duration of their whole banner, so long as you're in range - but you can't always rely on a Buff Banner being equipped or alive at all times.

The Back Scatter in base TF2 is a weird weapon used by Scouts to mini-crit players from behind. It serves as a flanking tool, but many would find doing that to be a death sentence in Zombie Escape.&#x20;

_Instead,_ this weapon plays on its streetsweeper shotgun design. It has 1.5 times the spread of the Scattergun and fires 12 pellets per shot, making it a very strong defensive option, but only up-close or in medium-range. Essentially this brings the Back Scatter to be a supportive scattergun, excelling in being able to defend consistently at the cost of its damage being lower than the other picks; the extra pellets attribute will also allow more zombies to be stalled simultaneously to protect other players on fallbacks, and lessen the pressure on incoming holds, making this pick an interesting option for players willing to put in extra work to make things easier on the entire team.
