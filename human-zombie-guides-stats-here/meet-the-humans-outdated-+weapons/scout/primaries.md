Considered one of the Scout's better primaries, the Back Scatter greatly excels at everything. It boasts the highest DPS that isn't a Heavy primary and defends well enough - due to having more bullets per shot and its wide spread. This is the weapon that defines Scout as an NPC/boss killer. It's best paired with Mad Milk for its potential overheal due to the close-range playstyle that the weapon promotes. Alternatively, pair it with Bonk! Atomic Punch for more speed.

The Force-A-Nature can be utilized as one of the **best** Scout primaries at defending; but it puts you at high risk of getting caught fleeing with its huge movement penalty. A solid pick for those who want to do more than just pinch zombies with a few pellets - this weapon highly incentivizes you to be nearly in the zombie's faces with it for most effectiveness, despite the inherent risk of getting caught backpedalling because of your already insanely low movement penalty. The damage vulnerability will also become a detriment if you're unfamiliar with maps that have bosses or NPCs, so bringing a _P.B.P.P_ couldn't hurt to keep your health tidied up.

Playing into Scout's niche, the Baby Face's Blaster allows him to push way past his base speed. This allows him to get triggers even faster, at the cost of his high DPS. Do be mindful of maps with NPCs, bosses, or map hazards that damage you. It only takes 25 damage to bring your boost down from 100 to 0 and you'll be left slowed down if there are no zombies to shoot at to regain your boost. The best secondaries to pair with the BFB are Bonk! Atomic Punch or any of the pistols. Use the Bonk! Atomic Punch with maximum BFB boost to move _even faster_, or the Pistol/Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol to compensate for the BFB's low DPS. Fall damage is no longer a worry either with this equipped, so this should let you easily grab triggers on maps that have it enabled.\


## Shortstop    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Shortstop (2).png>)

With its increased accuracy, the Shortstop allows Scout to maintain a good distance from the zombies while defending. While it loses out to the Back Scatter in many aspects, it makes up for it in its accurate shots. The best secondaries to pair with the Soda Popper are Bonk! Atomic Punch and Mad Milk.

## Soda Popper    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Soda\_Popper (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                    | Damage                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 8 Shots                                           | Clip DPS - 230.76 DPS           |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+70% Faster Firing Speed**</mark> | Attack Interval - 0.19          |

| <mark style="color:orange;">**Hype is Disabled**</mark>       | **Real DPS** - 158 DPS          |

The best way to sum up the soda popper is that it's very much another`do-it-all` type of weapon for Scout and doesn't exactly excel anywhere over the other choices offered here - you'll mostly only want this one in particular if you value weapon swapping speed with your increased pellets, letting you get off a secondary switch into barely enough of a push to get a zombie off someone's tail; considering that damage penalty. Mostly overshadowed by the Backscatter again; decent enough to get by with though.



## Scattergun    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Scattergun (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                    | Damage                          |

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Pending description rework?**</mark> Although arguably the best Scout primary in vanilla TF2, it is unfortunately **very poor** here. The only real _"advantage"_ it has is the increased fire rate; which is really next to nothing when you compare it to the other picks like the Backscatter damage-wise or the Force-A-Nature for its increased knockback capabilities (which also sports an even slightly higher fire rate than this too.)
