A crutch for some or a tactical advantage for others (really just a crutch), the Dead Ringer is one of the more powerful items in TF2 ZE. Those familiar with vanilla TF2 can see why. Holding this out, you will be able to tank most sources of damage - you'll notably have less damage resistance to map hazards. Use it to weave in and out of zombie hordes by going in for stabs and tanking a hit if things don't go according to plan. When used against NPCs and bosses, the Dead Ringer mitigates some of damage they deal to you, potentially saving your life! This weapon allows Spy to be a fantastic doorhugger on maps where hazards could easily kill a Scout. Also be mindful that the Dead Ringer gives a speed boost on activation, allowing you rush triggers much quicker by purposely activating it upon receiving fall damage. The speed boost should help with the flow of fighting zombies, but expect expecting zombies to account for it and be on the lookout. Additionally, watch out for any Mutations that cause AoE damage as they can proc your Dead Ringer too early. You can even cheese boss attacks with this especially if healing is disabled!

## Invisibility Watch   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Invis\_Watch.png)

| Attributes                                                                                             |

| <mark style="color:orange;">**Bumping in to enemies will make you slightly visible to enemies**</mark> |

The Invisibility Watch won't be as powerful a utility as the Dead Ringer, especially for doorhugging, as NPCs and bosses will still chase after you even while you're invisible. But, it'll at least allow you to sneak into the zombie backlines more easily. Use this with a more careful playstyle of actually backstabbing zombies, sneaking past enemy lines, and striking when you see fit. Just be mindful that, unless at full HP, you'll typically die in one hit from a zombie melee despite the 20% damage reduction, forcing you to be more mindful of your position and avoid getting caught out.
