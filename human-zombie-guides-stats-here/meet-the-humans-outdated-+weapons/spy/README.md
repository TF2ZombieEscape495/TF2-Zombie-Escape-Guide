The Spy is a tricky class to play effectively in Zombie Escape. Having the highest DPS towards zombies usually instantly killing them on backstab, his main job in Zombie Escape is to reliably deal with NPCs and Bosses with his high damage and survivability while being able to lessen pressure from the zombie horde by going on chainstabs to kill zombies if the defense fails. This requires him to get up and close even being among the horde to go for stabs. If you want to be greedy and go for chainstabs, your ÜberCharge and speedboost on backstab will only take you so far. If the zombies actually pay attention, you'll be met with bodyblocks preventing you rom escaping.\
\
Not only does the Spy have high DPS with his melees, but he also has high DPS with his revolvers making them perfect for taking down NPCs and bosses. They also have a fast fire rate, which is enough to deal with single zombies. Against a horde of them, it's less effective. There's a few knives you can play around with as well with different functionalities. The penultimate obstacle will still be one-shots from zombies, so it's primarily up to skill and strategy whether you survive or not rather than any of the added effects they provide.\
\
On top of all this, Spy has access to either his Invis Watch to sneak behind or his Dead Ringer to tank a zombie hit or NPC/Boss damage in case things go sideways. His Red-Tape recorder provides self-healing whereas the Sapper provides a minute speedboost. Given his diverse toolset, there's a lot of jobs Spy can perform: high-value target killer, npc and boss killer, triggerer, etc. Ultimately, it'll be up to you to play things smart to actually perform these jobs well
