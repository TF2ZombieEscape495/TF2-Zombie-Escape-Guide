## Knife   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Knife.png)

| Attributes                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**You become ÜberCharged and gain a speedboost on a backstab.**</mark> |

The stock Knife is your standard weapon of choice. You gain ÜberCharge and a speed boost on backstab without any of the potential downsides of other knives. Reliable and consistent though do note that very rarely, the knife will glitch out and not give you the ÜberCharge or speedboost on back stab although this applies to all knives. But then again, when aren't backstabs glitchy?

## Big Earner ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Big\_Earner (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+70% Cloak on Kill**</mark>                                                                                   |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25 Max Health on Wearer**</mark>                                                                              |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**You become ÜberCharged on a backstab (halfed time!) and only gain a speedboost on a backstab kill.**</mark> |

Although the Big Earner lets you get cloak upon getting a kill, you typically want to be at full cloak when going for backstabs as the Dead Ringer is usually the preferred choice among spies - in a pinch though, you can quickly build back any cloak or dead ringer to get away. You also only get _half the Übercharge time_ _on stab and_ the _s_peed-boost only applies upon actually killing a zombie with a backstab; making this less optimal than stock at chaining unless you hit all of your stabs. Though the -25 max hp and only getting a speedboost upon backstab kill isn't as crippling of downsides as the other knives.

## Spy-Cicle   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Spy-cicle.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**On Hit by Fire: Fireproof for 1 second and Afterburn immunity for 10 seconds**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Melts in fire, regenerates in 15 seconds and by picking up ammo**</mark>              |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Backstab turns victim to ice**</mark>                                                 |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**You become ÜberCharged and gain a speedboost on a backstab.**</mark>                  |

While the extinguishing effect can play a niche role of saving you from fire damage when at low health, the big issue is actually being able to use the Spy-cicle. It will not be uncommon for Pyros to spam their Mutations resulting in fire damage being taken frequently. This will effectively prevent you from being able to use your knife causing you to wait and rely on your guns to stall or be idle with your sappers. You can already extinguish yourself with the Dead Ringer and the Pyro Mutation afterburn is rarely a threat used alone. Plus, one of the biggest aspects of Spy is being able to save yourself off backstab when caught in dangerous scenarios. Even as a doorhugging spy that doesn't go for backstabs, the stock knife at least lets you potentially save yourself or your team when backed into a corner. Without a knife to do it, you'll be left in the cold sore outta luck.

## Conniver's Kunai   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Conniver's\_Kunai.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-55 Max Health on Wearer**</mark>                                                                 |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Backstab: Absorbs the health from your victim**</mark>                                      |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**You are overhealed to 300 hp on a backstab kill. You gain a speedboost on a backstab.**</mark> |

The Conniver's Kunai is an interesting choice as it **instead** overheals you to 300 hp on a backstab kill. In almost all cases, an ÜberCharge gained from other knives will save you just as well if not more so. Backstabs, Bushwhacka snipers using their Mutation or even two consecutive zombie hits will kill you that an ÜberCharge could have saved you from. It's also worth mentioning that it gives you less max HP, making damage against NPCs and bosses even more deadly when you have no zombies to backstab. As a result, the main benefit of this knife will be the burst healing it provides in the very small off chance you need the health over Über to survive.

## Your Eternal Reward   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Your\_Eternal\_Reward (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+33% cloak drain rate**</mark>                                                                                                                   |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% damage vs players**</mark>                                                                                                                  |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Upon a successful backstab against a human target, you rapidly disguise as a**</mark>** **<mark style="color:blue;">**\[Blu teammate]**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Disguises do not require cloak meter.**</mark>                                                                                                 |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Reduced Decloak Sound**</mark>                                                                                                                 |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Silent Killer: No attack noise from backstabs**</mark>                                                                                         |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**You do not become ÜberCharged and do not gain a speedboost on a backstab.**</mark>                                                             |

Since the ÜberCharge on backstab effect is removed, all that the Eternal Reward should be good for is stealthily chain-stabbing, or especially picking out zombie item users now that it dishes out more damage-capablity. However, the auto-cloak does not work properly as it only disguises you as a **Blu** teammate rather than **Red**. Added onto that, disguising will take up your **entire cloak.** This will delay the time before you can sneak into the zombie backlines or the ability to survive with the Dead Ringer.
