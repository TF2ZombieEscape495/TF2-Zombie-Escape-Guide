## Powerjack   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Powerjack.png)

| Attributes                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +5% Faster Movement Speed on Wearer**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +25 health restored on kill**</mark>         |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: 40% damage vulnerability on wearer**</mark>   |

The only Pyro weapon that provides utility, it should be no surprise that The Powerjack is on top with its ability to increase your speed while held out. Although, the damage vulnerability tradeoff can be dangerous at times. Just remember not to have it out for simple things like falls or during boss fights!

## Hot Hand   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Hot\_Hand.png)

| Attributes                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-20% damage penalty**</mark>                                |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Gain a speed boost when you hit an enemy player**</mark> |

Funny enough, the double-hit lets you quickly two-shot Heavy Mutations while providing a nice speed boost for doing so. This in mind makes this the second best Pyro melee for ZE.

## Axtinguisher   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Axtinguisher.png)

| Attributes                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-33% Damage Penalty**</mark>                                          |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-35% Holster Speed**</mark>                                           |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Mini-crits burning targets and extinguishes them.**</mark>         |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Damage increases based on remaining duration of afterburn**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Killing blows on burning players grant a speed boost**</mark>      |

The Axtinguisher allows Pyro to minicrit burning zombies. Used on Heavies who Mutation or zombies near-death and engulfed in flames, you will deal increased damage with a potential speed boost if you land a kill. The Hot Hand, however, does this much better while not having a 35% holster penalty. This holster penalty may also have a negative effect of disallowing you from swapping to a ranged weapon quick enough to push or hold a zombie back if you miss your swing.

## Neon Annihilator   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Neon\_Annihilator.png)

| Attributes                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**100% critical hit vs wet players**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-20% damage penalty vs players**</mark>    |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Damage removes Sappers**</mark>         |

The Neon Annihilator shares the same attribute as the Homewrecker for removing Sappers. Since zombies can't sap buildings nor are there usually any buildings for you to destroy, this would make Homewrecker somewhat obsolete and the Neon Annihilator having the only benefit of potentially increased damage. This increase is extremely situational as it only comes into play when you fight in watery terrain or if you have a zombies Mad Milked or Jarated. But hey, it's better than nothing right?

## Third Degree   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Third\_Degree.png)

| Attributes                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**All players connected via Medigun beams are hit**</mark> |

While it may be a direct upgrade to the Axe in base TF2, it sees no upside here due to zombies being unable to pocket med each other.

## Axe   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Fire\_Axe.png)![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Lollichop.png)

Remember to equip the Third Degree so you can truly screw over your Medic trying to save you after you get infected!

## Backscratcher   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Back\_Scratcher.png)

| Attributes                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Damage Bonus**</mark>                    |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% health from packs on wearer**</mark>     |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**-75% health from healers on wearer**</mark> |

You will be hard pressed to find maps that actually feature the use of health packs. The reduced healing from other healing sources will prove to be extremely detrimental as your main source of healing will be greatly reduced. This will only intensify with Pyro's playstyle of getting dangerously close to zombies to stall while taking damage repeatedly.

## Volcano Fragment   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Sharpened\_Volcano\_Fragment.png)

| Attributes                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-20% damage penalty**</mark>                     |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**On Hit: target is engulfed in flames**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Afterburn duration is 7.5 seconds**</mark>    |

The Afterburn isn't worth it, nor is the damage penalty. Sad weapon.
