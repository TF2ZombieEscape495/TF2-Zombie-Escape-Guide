Reliable as a mid ranged option, the stock Shotgun is the premier choice for pyros in ZE. Since flamethrowers are short ranged weapons, the Shotgun is a good way of keeping zombies a safer distance away - especially in cases where your airblast isn't going to work on knocking zombies back. The Shotgun also lets pyros damage NPCs and bosses as flamethrower fire does nearly zero damage against them. This is just a solid, reliable option.

The Reserve Shooter exhibits two features of the new shotguns: increased damage and lesser firing speed. The main aspect of this shotgun in particular is the increased accuracy - giving a feel much akin to something like the frontier justice in terms of singling out particular zombies and not having the same spread of multi-coverage; (which your flamethrower should be doing anyway) - a good go-to for when a map requires a DPS check for both Pyro and Soldier. Another downside worth noting is you'll have six less shots than stock.

An alternative option for the shotgun that can _also_ be used by Soldier, Heavy, and Engineer - This one succeeds well in providing a very short burst of cover for moments where zombies are right behind you and you need them off your tail. The extra deploy speed is going to help with that a lot if you aren't rocking the Degreaser. Basically a mini-minigun condensed into a secondary but you will have to spend downtime reloading. Not exactly good for prolonged periods of delaying due to its accuracy falloff - _which you should instead be using your flames for_, but also has the niche wherein if a map has an [**ammo item**](../../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md) you can activate that and absolutely **shred** down a boss with the insanely high firerate from using one of said infinite ammo powerups.

The Detonator particularly specializes in a focus on slowing down zombies through its right-click AoE damage, akin to the Short Circuit. While it can _theoretically_ perma-slow zombies, it requires much more skill than either the Flamethrower or the Short Circuit, and a well-used enough detonation can send zombies off pitfalls (or boost them less favorably like the prior picks) and has the **least** damage against NPCs/bosses `(func_breakables)` in pyro secondaries; but it's ranked higher due to the skill ceiling in being able to launch groups of zombies from specific angles without direct hits.

A projectile that particularly can slow or launch singular zombies on hit with very little reload downtime; falling off against hoardes where your flamethrowers will excel; but also a good damage option for Pyro against bosses that are `func_breakables` and mostly stationary. As with all flare picks; still capable of boosting zombies in use but nowhere _near as far_ as previous iterations with minicrits instead - falling off at longer range.

The Scorch Shot, which, _was_ replaced with an unmodified Flare Gun; is now something akin of a Detonator alternative, focused on easily spreading afterburn damage against a zombie horde. Compared to the Detonator, it deals better damage against everything, but fares more poorly at reliably slowing down zombies in mid-to-long ranges.

The Manmelter is a faster version of the Flare Gun, more suited to pushing back zombies with both a faster firing speed and a faster projectile speed. Essentially this pick trades _some_ damage (against `func_breakables`) for a far more annoying weapon against zombies - and considering the speed, it can keep up with a couple or few of them at once.

Also note that the Manmelter does have an incredibly niche use of being able to extinguish teammates in the event you run out of flamethrower ammo.

~~`Instantly kills all the zombies coated by this, revives your entire team, destroys every single NPC and Boss, does your taxes, solves world hunger, and can even win the Nobel Prize. The Gas Passer will make your team question whether you're trolling or genuinely clueless.`~~ ~~_Old version's decription was funny enough to keep; it's not this bad now._~~

A complete rework to the Gas Passer since the former versions were extremely buggy. Essentially this option throws an **incendiary grenade** that damages both zombies and bosses, making it useful for flinging zombies and taking down bosses. However, it deprives the Pyro of a reliable knockback option, making it less useful for defending _(not delaying)_ alongside the team in places where you may need to hold.
