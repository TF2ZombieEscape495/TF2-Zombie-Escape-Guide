\
<mark style="color:blue;">**Pros**</mark>

* Extremely effective for spacing, pushing back\
  zombies, and stalling
* Fire from his flamethrower can easily stall groups of zombies
* Can easily extinguish teammates

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons**</mark>

* Low DPS for bosses and NPCs\
  (flames essentially do 0 to no damage to them!)
* Has to be up close to zombies to be effective
* Airblast resistance means that more Pyros make\
  them less effective
* Flame throwers can outpace ammo regeneration

\
Utilizing their flamethrowers, Pyro's main job in Zombie Escape is defense support and stalling the zombies on fall backs. Set zombies on fire to slow them down or airblast them if they get too close. Make sure you have shotguns though as you can't deal damage to NPCs or bosses using your fire!\
\
Important to note is that zombies gain airblast resistance each time they are hit by one. This will reduce their knockback from it and gradually come to a point where airblasts are completely negated. This effect will stack until it resets after approximately 10 seconds. In addition to that, Pyro's flamethrowers tend to run out of ammo quickly the more you airblast, so watch your ammo count.\
\
Since you have to get so close to the zombies, be careful of any Mutations that might stun you or that ignore knockback. To space yourself and keep a safe distance, use shotguns. Flare guns can be interesting with their ridulous knockback, but this usually results in zombies being boosted at the team. Topping it all off, if even more mobility is your thing, try out the Powerjack but be careful as all sources of damage will do 40% more damage to you!
