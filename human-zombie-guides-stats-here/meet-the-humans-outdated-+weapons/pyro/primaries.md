The Degreaser is a powerful tool that is able to utilize the stock Flamethrower's main strengths with the added benefit of a quicker switch speed. Its biggest downside is the increased airblast cost requiring you to be a bit more mindful about airblast usage. Use it strategically and alternate with your flames.

Use the faster switch speed to quickly swap to the Powerjack and run away, swap to shotguns to reload faster, or to bring your melee out and kill low zombies. The last note is most important for taking down Heavy Mutations that negate your airblast. If caught too close, you'll have a split second to quick-switch and take them out before they take you out.

Great at slowing with its flames and having access to powerful airblasts, the Flamethrower is a good all-around choice for pyro. Set groups of zombies on fire to slow them down and airblast them back if you need spacing. If the environment allows it, do yourself one better and airblast them into map hazards or teleports to lessen the amount of zombies you have to deal with. Just be careful with spamming airblast due to airblast resistance and take note of your steadily depleting ammo count.

Able to send groups of zombies back with immense force, the Backburner allows Pyro to utilize more powerful but more costly airblasts. Since their primary is only at 140 ammo, you're really only allowed **one airblast**. This promotes a different playstyle compared to how Pyro is normally played. Rather than aggressively stalling close to the zombies, you can play further away more passively.

This passive playstyle promotes only airblasting at opportune times while avoiding use of flames for the most part. Thus, you can stall with secondaries away from the frontlines until it's absolutely necessary for you to move in. If you do want to use your flames, then be even more careful with your ammo count such that you can airblast them at the most ideal moment, such as when you can airblast the entirety of the Zombie team into map hazards or teleport triggers.

| <mark style="color:orange;">**Extinguishing teammates restores 20 health**</mark>                                                                         |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Uses a shared pressure tank for Primary Fire and Alt-Fire.**</mark>                                                         |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Primary Fire: Launches a fast moving projectile that briefly ignites enemies**</mark>                                       |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: Release a blast of air that pushes enemies and projectiles, and extinguishes teammates that are on fire.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**This single-shot flamethrower rewards consecutive hits with faster reloads and bonus damage.**</mark>                       |

At an initial glance, the Dragon's Fury might not seem like it's all that different from its Vanilla stats - but it comes with an extended range over the other picks, _and_ the slowdown of landing the fireball projectile is actually _**greater**_ than that of any other flamethrower slowing, allowing you to significantly bully out pockets of zombies in the front-lines; so long as you consistently land your shots, _(as missing will lead to a slower firing rate.)_ Though once those pockets of zombies become _hordes_ is where you'll start having problems in delaying; as you can't exactly just flick the flame and ignite 20 zombies in one fell swoop, unless they're conveniently lined up; and this weapon in particular has the **longest** airblast cooldown, so try to use it wisely!

## Phlogistinator   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Phlogistinator (1).png>)

| <mark style="color:blue;">**+10% Damage Bonus**</mark>                                                    |

| <mark style="color:orange;">**Invulnerable while 'Mmmph' taunting.**</mark>                               |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**`No airblast.`**</mark>                                                     |

The Phologistinator is essentially the stock Flamethrower but with <mark style="color:red;">**no airblast.**</mark>** The crits granted does not increase the slow from your flames!** Due to the lack of airblast - the phlog now specializes in damaging and slowing down zombies en masse with more effectiveness than the other flamethrower options, albeit having to rely entirely on teammates or a secondary for its flaw - it might be a decent pick if you don't like being so close to zombies at all; and can let you set aflame something like a heavy enzyme a little more reliably before it goes off.
