<mark style="color:blue;">**Pros**</mark>

* Has access to buildings for support
* Buildings can serve as blockades
* Great for helping hold down longer defenses
* Excellent at stalling large amounts of zombies via the [Short Circuit](secondaries.md#short-circuit)

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons**</mark>

* Can **only** set up **mini-sentries** and **dispensers.**
* Buildings are deleted upon jumping on them to prevent jump-height specific exploits
* May be unable to place buildings in certain areas
  * Buildings easily blocked by having large amounts of teammates

With the ability to build dispensers and sentries, Engineer naturally falls into the role of team support in Zombie Escape. With dispensers, the team will be able to replenish both ammo and health to withstand and recover from zombie hits or environmental damage. With mini-sentries, he can help bolster defenses with its auto-targeting allowing him to focus on repairing it or other buildings or allow himself to target zombies in tandem.\
\
**Catering to his unique ability to place buildings, Engineer's weapons all revolve around certain playstyles.** Each [Wrench](melees.md) is modified to give different dispenser ranges, build speeds, firing speeds, and more. These can affect how a team holds and how you yourself can defend. The unfortunate part is that you may not be able to build in certain areas within maps. For example, sometimes you'll be able to set up dispensers in boss arenas for assisted healing, other times not. But even if you could, some maps nerf or disable healing from dispensers entirely during these fights making them useless.\
\
Regardless, Engineers are primarily for helping the team actually get there. His toolset invites a more passive playstyle where you let your buildings - and the team - do all the work. **Do note that the mini-sentries you set up will start out with little ammo requiring you to hit it a few times to replenish it.** This micro-managing will be intensified if it has a faster fire rate. Then you'll also have to worry about repairing things, whether or not it's safe to move buildings, where you can and can't build...\
\
Well, I guess you can't play _too_ passively.
