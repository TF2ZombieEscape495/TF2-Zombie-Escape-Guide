Seemingly useless at first glance, you might think the Short Circuit is in the same tier as the Bison or Pomson. However, this is a fantastic Engineer weapon that lets you slow many zombies in an AoE turning you into a psuedo Pyro. Amazing for fallbacks and considering you mainly use your primary to defend anyway, the Short Circuit provides great utility to the Engineer. The only cases where this weapon can fall off usage-wise is if map geometry doesn't allow for the alt-fire projectile to travel anywhere and dissipates nearly immediately - this tends to happen on moving platforms, tight doorways, or elevators.

Providing the _second best_ DPS for an Engineer, the Pistol provides good damage while being a better option at defending from further range than the Frontier Justice. It does nearly double the damage a Shotgun does and allows you to focus fire and knockback a singular zombie much more while having the downside that it doesn't spread like the shotguns which prevents it from used to slow against multiple zombies. The pistol doesn't get much in utility due to its high damage potential - assuming you aren't using Frontier for exactly that; it can help make up for missing it.

## Wrangler   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Wrangler.png)

| <mark style="color:blue;">**+20% Sentry Firing Speed**</mark>                                                                                        |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+200% Sentry Build Speed**</mark>                                                                                        |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+200% Dispenser Range**</mark>                                                                                           |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Take manual control of your Sentry Gun Wrangled sentries gain a shield that reduces damage and repairs by 66%**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Sentries are disabled for 3 seconds after becoming unwrangled**</mark>                                                 |

A potential lifesaver, the Wrangler allows your Dispenser to have a much further range while making your sentry far more tankier, **and building it quicker.** The main benefit of this weapon is the extended dispenser range, causing you to save potentially more of your teammates during boss fights that let you heal normally with its extended range. Another purpose of actually using the weapon other than to use its passives; is to create a shielded blockade for zombies to be unable to pass through, making it especially useful on doors and narrow holes. However, the sentry is short enough that a zombie could easily jump over it, and the sentry repairs are significantly nerfed making it mediocre as a blockade compared to the much taller Dispenser.
