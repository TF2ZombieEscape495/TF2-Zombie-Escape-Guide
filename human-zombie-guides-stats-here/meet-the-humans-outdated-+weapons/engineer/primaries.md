| Attributes                                                                                                                                 | Damage                           |

One of the epitomes of shotguns aside from the Backscatter - this option is going to dish out some of the highest damage _(just about over double that of a shotgun)_ because of the tighter spread and extra pellet count, falling only slightly flat at stopping waves of zombies in your face but nothing a short circuit or pistol swap between this can't handle. Can't go wrong with stacking more engineers alone because of this weapon either, it's one of the best choices at the moment for versatility on the class - the other picks here are mostly just alright and do have their share of niches.

## Panic Attack   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Panic\_Attack (3).png>)

| Attributes                                                                   | Damage                          |

| <mark style="color:orange;">**Successive shots become less accurate**</mark> | **Real DPS** - 79.4 DPS         |
|                                                                              |                                 |

An alternative option for the shotgun that can _also_ be used by Soldier, Pyro, and Heavy - This one succeeds well in providing a very short burst of cover for moments where zombies are right behind you and you need them off your tail. The extra deploy speed is going to help a lot between that and your secondary choice of stalling. You do have to spend more downtime reloading it, thus it's not exactly good for prolonged periods of delaying - which you do have a couple better options as secondaries for; _pistol and short circuit,_ but also has the niche wherein if a map has an [ammo item](../../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md) you can activate that and absolutely shred down a boss with the insanely high firerate from using one of said infinite ammo powerups.

## Shotgun   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Shotgun (1) (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                    | Damage                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 18 Shots                                          | Clip DPS - 171.429 DPS          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+70% Faster Firing Speed**</mark> | Base Damage - 36 per shot       |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+60% Faster Reload Time**</mark>  | Attack Interval - 0.210         |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-40% Damage Penalty**</mark>       | TEC - 3.780 seconds             |
|                                                               | Reload Time (F) - 0.400 seconds |
|                                                               | Reload Time (C) - 0.200 seconds |
|                                                               | Full Reload Time- 3.800 seconds |
|                                                               | **Real DPS** - 85.488 DPS       |

At one point the Frontier used to have no knockback - so this choice alone was infinitely way better defense-wise, but nowadays the only reason you could argue to use it is for the extra 6 clip shot - which really isn't going to be as much of a game changer as the Frontier is against bosses or NPCs. Again, not a _bad weapon_ when it's the prime pick for the other classes with it - but overshadowed for Engineer.

## Rescue Ranger   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Rescue\_Ranger (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clip Size - 10 Shots                                                                                          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% Faster Firing Speed**</mark>                                                 |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+40% Faster Reload Time**</mark>                                                  |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% Sentry Damage Bonus**</mark>                                                 |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Projectiles Penetrate Enemy Players**</mark>                                    |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Alt-Fire: Use 50 metal to pick up your target building from long range**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Fires a special bolt that can repair friendly buildings**</mark>                |
| <mark style="color:red;">**Self mark for death when hauling buildings**</mark>                                |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**4-to-1 health-to-metal ratio when repairing buildings**</mark>                  |
| <mark style="color:red;">**Projectile cannot damage breakable objects**</mark>                                |

Satisfying a couple niches, the Rescue Ranger can penetrate through zombies, allowing you to defend well in very narrow hallways or chokepoints while also giving you the ability to move your buildings around without having to lug them around. It also lets you safely repair buildings from a distance without putting yourself in danger, which is great if you're using them as blockades. One more beneficial thing worth mentioning is that it also beefs up your sentry gun's damage (knockback) power. However, the Rescue Ranger is far worse at holding zombies back compared to the shotgun options and **can't damage NPCs or Bosses.**

| <mark style="color:orange;">**Uses Metal for Ammo**</mark>                                                          |                        |

This weapon will debuff your sentry gun's fire rate but increase your knockback damage on your sentry's active target. Really gimmicky, but decent for tight hold maps that need you hunkering down somewhere a while. It does falter off at long distance cover either since you need to be closer to zombies to ensure most of your pellets hit for a full, worthwhile metal return; encouraging pinpoint aim with it generally; and with precise shots you can keep a _very long uptime of_ firing/defense.

Will not gain any ammo upon hitting breakables (Bosses & NPCs) - effectively making it near useless when you run out of metal so soon. Just bring a pistol for that DPS coverage if you use this.

The Pomson - much like the rescue ranger, also has projectile penetration on enemies and the range use of a short circuit for slow to actually matter - but you'll pretty much be lacking in breakable damage much like the last two picks, making the pistol or wrangled sentry a near must-have if you want to contribute to damaging a boss. ~~Still a poor weapon overall and very little meta incentive to pick it other than the **pew pew** sound.~~
