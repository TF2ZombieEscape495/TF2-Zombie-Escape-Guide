The Frontier Justice is a weapon that rewards Engineers who play in tandem with their sentries in base TF2. It allows them to build up stored crits after their sentries kill enemy players and are destroyed. This mechanic doesn’t serve much of a purpose in Zombie Escape, given that players generally shoot constantly. Any reasonable amount of crits gained over the course of a round will be lost in a few seconds, as merely holding onto them will be detrimental to the player and the team.&#x20;

Instead, this weapon plays into its current niche in Zombie Escape **as the weapon with the highest DPS among all the shotguns;** (at \~190 DPS) falling only flat at stopping waves of zombies in your face due a small clip, but nothing a short circuit or pistol swap between this can't handle.

The Panic Attack in base TF2 has gone through many revisions. It was originally a charged burst weapon that fired much faster the lower one’s health was. Now, it’s a rapid-fire burst weapon that loses accuracy the longer one keeps firing. These modifications follow the trend of the latter, as this weapon has been reworked into an immediate response option for players caught out by groups of zombies.

Currently the weapon stands as the **fastest-firing yet slowest-reloading** shotgun. With a TEC time of 2.43 seconds and a FRT of 5.4 seconds, this produces an extremely low uptime-downtime ratio of 0.45. This means that this weapon is **highly unsustainable for long-term defenses** and should only be used if necessary. This weapon has a 37% damage penalty, leading to the lowest sustained DPS among all shotguns at \~130. But, because this weapon boasts an extremely high fire rate, its nonstop DPS is actually **one of the highest among all weapons at 420 **_**(provided that you have an**_ [_**ammo item.**_](../../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md#human-items)_**)**_

Even if this weapon has low sustained DPS, it evens out by being given a damage bonus to players in an attempt to make it more effective for close-range knockback in hitting multiple zombies due to the spread 'penalty' applying to extra pellets. With all this in effect, hopefully this becomes a weapon Pyros, Heavies, and Soldiers can consider as an option should they tend to over-defend or get caught out often. The low damage and high spread also make this weapon less appealing for fast-moving boss fights, so try to _avoid_ using it on maps that require optimal DPS or accurate shots to win unless you're comfortable with getting up close.

## Shotgun   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Shotgun (3).png>)

The stock shotgun is pretty much the de facto weapon used by new players or those overwhelmed by all the weapon changes. It also sets the precedent for pretty much all shotgun-esque weapons. This weapon's base DPS is around \~150, which is a damage range all weapons will hover around with a lowered fire rate to compensate.

Reliable as a mid ranged option, the stock Shotgun is still a good choice for Engineer since it has a large clip size to cover yourself with; but tends to be overshadowed by the Frontier Justice in terms of damage, only having a slightly higher fire rate to compensate for that too.

The Rescue Ranger is a unique utility weapon for Engineers in base TF2. It allows them to pick up their buildings from a distance at the cost of metal and serves as a decent damage option if they can land their shots.&#x20;

In Zombie Escape, the Rescue Ranger satisfies a couple niches by being given penetration against zombies, allowing you to spam it out and slow large groups of zombies in very narrow hallways or chokepoints while also giving you the ability to move your buildings around without having to lug them around _(Namely dispensers.)_

It also lets you safely repair buildings from a distance without putting yourself in danger, which is great if you're using them as blockades. One more beneficial thing worth mentioning is that it also beefs up your sentry gun's damage (knockback) power. However, the Rescue Ranger is far worse at _holding zombies back_ compared to the shotgun options and <mark style="color:red;">**can't damage NPCs or Bosses.**</mark>

The Widowmaker is a very unique primary for Engineers in base TF2. It's gimmick is that it uses metal for ammo and returns the amount of damage dealt as ammo. This can allow Engineers to fire nonstop should their damage to players exceed the cost of ammo per shot.&#x20;

It also features increased damage to the user's sentry's target, which should allow more knockback to that target. One would think this weapon would be extremely overpowered in Zombie Escape, and it certainly can be. However, current changes have made it somewhat underwhelming. \
\
On maps with tighter enclosures the weapon can get some decent mileage going in having long uptimes; so long as you pinpoint your shots at a closer range _(to ensure the most metal return)_ from pellets not going astray.&#x20;

Also falling into the same problem as the other gimmicky Engineer weapons - **you'll be doing almost no damage to bosses** with this, _(very, very minimal.)_

The Pomson 6000 is essentially an Engineer's Righteous Bison with additional perks. Currently the weapon has been given a side-upgrade providing enemy slowdown on hit to a **minimum of 240 HU/s for \~2 seconds**.&#x20;

With a larger clip size than prior iterations, it might be slightly worthwhile to use on zombies as it also buffs your sentry knockback some to make up for lack of knockback; but it will still remain <mark style="color:red;">**useless against most NPCs and bosses**</mark> as energy projectiles do not damage a majority of them.
