Sniper in Zombie Escape is simple in concept but hard to play in practice. His main job is zombie deterrence and stalling either from afar or up close if you're cheeky enough. This is thanks to his ability to knockback zombies on headshot. Target zombies that pop their Mutations to shut them down completely or stall them before they can reach your teammates. There will be a lot of nuance to playing Sniper and things you have to watch for, but, played effectively, it can feel very rewarding.\
\
Akin to his name, the Sniper is able to snipe zombies from afar to deal large amounts of damage. Base value, this will be _**\~900 dmg**_ on headshot with modifiers according to buffs or debuffs the zombies may have. As more and more humans die, this base damage will increase even while the zombies' starting health decreases. Bodyshotting zombies will deal the same amount of damage in vanilla TF2 and is therefore useless due to the high hp scaling of Zombies. Only when zombies are extremely low in hp does it serve a niche for quick dispatching if there's no time to scope in.\
\
Since the Sniper's primary weapons already perform strongly if used properly, the only change is the headshot damage. His [smg](secondaries.md#cleaners-carbine) secondaries are buffed to allow him to fend for himself or give him spacing if zombies catch up whereas his [other secondaries](secondaries.md#jarate) only serve small niches. Your [melees](melees.md) won't matter all too much against zombies _as none of them really provide self-buffs for the moment_ - I mean, you're a sniper, just headshot them!
