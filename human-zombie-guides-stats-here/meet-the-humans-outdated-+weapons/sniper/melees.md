# Melees

## Kukri   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Kukri.png)

Good ol' reliable knife. Can't really go wrong with it having no downsides.

## Bushwhacka   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Bushwacka.png)

| Attributes                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: +20% Damage Vulnerability on Wearer**</mark>            |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**When Held: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit.**</mark> |

The Bushwhacka, despite giving a 20% damage vulnerability while active, lets you essentially triple the damage you deal to a Heavy using their Mutation, typically killing the Heavy. Since most Snipers run Cleaner's Carbine and few run Jarate, it's unlikely the upside will come into play when dealing with Heavies. At least you'll have the convenience of having the Bushwacka ready for zombie Sniper killing sprees if you do get infected.

## Shahanshah   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Shahanshah.png)

| Attributes                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+25% Increase in Damage when Health <50% of Max**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25% Decrease in Damage when Health >50% of Max**</mark>  |

In most cases, you'll be topped off with Overheal or at least not dying. If you are dying, chances are you'll be entirely dead soon anyways making the Shahanshah's -25% decrease in damage not even play a role. You will more than likely be able to utilize the +25% increase in damage if you need the extra push to take a zombie out. Although, even that won't be too necessary as melee damage is not too important in most scenarios.



## Tribalman's Shiv   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Tribalman's\_Shiv.png)

| Attributes                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-50% Damage Penalty**</mark>            |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**On Hit: Bleed for 6 seconds**</mark> |

The bleed provided from the Tribalman's Shiv won't offer much help especially when you need burst damage in the event you ever do pull out your melee during last man stands. You'll be better off using any other Sniper melee.
