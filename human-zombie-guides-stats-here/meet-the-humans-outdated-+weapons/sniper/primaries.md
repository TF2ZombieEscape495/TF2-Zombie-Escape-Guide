As a Sniper, you want to be headshotting zombies whenever and as fast as possible. The Hitman's Heatmaker has a unique Focus feature that allows you to charge it by headshotting zombies. When full, you are able to continually shoot zombies without having to rescope. With this, you can fire repeatedly and uninterrupted without having to worry about the timings for firing after scoping in if you want to shoot as fast as you can. This is a great utility for continually focus-firing on groups of zombies, especially with the improved reload time between shots - _however_ you'll be <mark style="color:red;">**penalized heavily**</mark> in movement **for holding it out;** so it's best used with some proper positioning like in the backlines; definitely ideal to carry either SMG with you to cover this weakness.

The stock Sniper Rifle has the same stats as vanilla TF2 aside from any aforementioned modifiers, like maximum damage on headshot without full charge and its stun ability. You really can't go wrong with this—or the rifles above the Huntsman for that matter—so feel free to use whichever one feels best for you.

This one's a bit unique in the regard that _at a baseline_ it's a very shabby weapon - with that reload time you'll be spending at least several seconds of downtime between shots - ensuring that every headshot's going to matter on whether you hit or not. But as you collect heads, your headshot charge time will increase per head, allowing you to proficiently dish out **upwards of 6K+ damage per charged shot** **depending on weapon interactions.** This can come handy in scenarios where there is a zombie item user or charged enzyme ready - you can effectively mow them down before they even are a threat to your team. One of the harder parts of this weapon though is getting <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[6]**</mark> heads consistently, as your teammates _(ergo, a backstab farming spy or even another sniper)_ will feel inclined to take the kill on a zombie you've been trying to farm one head from; so sometimes you'll have to play it patient with watching their health to guarantee a kill to get this weapon cooking.

Unlike the other sniper rifles, the Sydney Sleeper does <mark style="color:red;">**not headshot stun**</mark> and can only apply Jarate effects both on headshot and bodyshot. The headshot effect **reduces cooldown on Jarate**  and can be useful if you want to throw that teleports or large clusters considering the prolonged time it takes to recharge. The jarate-shot also allows for you to be a pest towards certain zombies and allows your team to focus-fire a coated zombie that might not have been as apperent beforehand.

If you aren't the best at aiming headshots or want to play Sniper more casually, the Huntsman might be the best fit for you. It still provides the ability to stun on headshot and you can spam arrows relatively fast. You can even light arrows on fire a bit of fire damage. The biggest downside, however, is that it uses arrows. They can be quite inconsistent and doesn't let you get as many shots in as the rifles' bullets. They won't be able to damage NPCs or bosses leaving you quite incapable of doing much unless you have an SMG equipped. Though you should be using your SMGs to do damage to bosses anyway. The extra bit of bleed proc being dished out won't really do anything special but maybe slightly annoy the zombies you're hitting with this some more.

The Machina works much like other sniper rifles, except with the niche of being able to penetrate players on full charge. You can use this to your advantage if you're aware of zombie teleport positions by lining up a shot to headshot multiple targets and multi-stun when they appear. However, this rifle's biggest downside is its inability to noscope, as well as the _slower reloading downtime;_ making it more of a priority to land your headshots. When finishing off a zombie or in a pinch, you won't be able to noscope for a quick kill or to save yourself. You can still headshot from afar, but if you're the cheeky type to stay up close and stall, you better be careful. The tracer rounds may also be somewhat detrimental by letting the zombies know where you're firing from. This will cause them to actively dodge or even chase you if you're trying to sneak by.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Pending description rework:**</mark> The Classic _can_ stun on headshot, but only after being fully charged. With how fast-paced ZE is and how you are almost always required to quickscope non-stop to make the most out of Sniper, this weapon is _somewhat_ counterintuitive, the charge & reload bonuses at least does it a favor in that regard. You'll be able to amass charge within at least a second or so; but missing your headshots is going to feel like a huge loss in damage to a zombie even then, bodyshots are just about useless too. One of the gimmicks of this rifle though is that you can run _while_ completely charged and not suffer a movement penalty - so if sniping on the go is preferable, then this one can be an interesting pick.
