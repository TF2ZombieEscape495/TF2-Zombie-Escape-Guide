In Zombie Escape, one could say it works the same as its vanilla counterpart - with the added ability of being able to knock back zombies on headshot.\
\
Stat-wise, the Sniper Rifle has been adjusted such;

* 75 damage on a bodyshot
* 225 on a full-charge bodyshot
* 900 damage on a headshot via plugin rescaling
* It has \~160 DPS, both with continuous non-charged and fully-charged firing.

This makes it simple to use and a decent option for those unconcerned about any new mechanics necessary to achieve maximal DPS values.

Currently, the Sydney Sleeper’s role in zombie escape is to rapidly apply the Jarate effect to zombies for increased damage, all the while **decreasing the downtime of Sniper’s throwable** [**Jarate.**](secondaries.md#jarate)

<mark style="color:red;">**It can’t headshot stun**</mark>, so this acts as enough of a downside. Otherwise, this maintains a slightly lower damage output than the stock Sniper Rifle ;

* 75 damage on a 0%-charged bodyshot
* 226 damage on a full-charge bodyshot
* 222 damage on a 0%-charged headshot
* 900 damage on a fully-charged headshot
* It deals \~150 DPS, both with continuous non-charged and fully-charged firing.

The knockback on headshot mechanic in Zombie Escape should persuade players enough to go for headshots, but that means they won't be able to rely on a noscope for emergency coverage if a zombie catches up to them.  Certain attributes were also emphasized to solidify this rifle's role as Sniper's "big gun" should they want to maximize their damage output.

At the cost of stunning zombies in quick succession as well as the user’s own safety, the Machina is capable of outputting DPS values on par with Heavy’s miniguns with pinpoint accuracy. This won’t require a build-up similar to the Bazaar Bargain, as this damage potential will be available outright. _However,_ to fully charge a shot, it will take around **\~4 seconds** and an additional **\~2 seconds** to refire.&#x20;

With the current attributes; it produces the following damage values:

* 283 damage on a 0%-charged bodyshot
* 1500 damage on a full-charge bodyshot
* 1500 damage on a headshot via plugin rescaling
* As for DPS, this deals \~170 DPS with continuous non-charged firing and \~300 DPS with continuous fully-charged firing.

Because this weapon can be so formidable at killing both zombies and bosses, it comes with several debuffs. This makes it a risky weapon to use if one doesn't time or position themselves well enough to make use of it. There is also a <mark style="color:red;">**movement penalty inflicted**</mark> when this weapon is held out, which emphasizes the idea that one needs to be careful when utilizing this weapon.

If you aren't the best at aiming headshots or want to play Sniper more casually, the Huntsman might be the best fit for you. It still provides the ability to knockback headshot and you can spam arrows relatively fast. You can even light arrows on fire a bit of fire damage. The biggest downside, however, is that it uses arrows. They can be quite inconsistent and doesn't let you get as many shots in as the rifles' bullets. <mark style="color:red;">**They won't be able to damage NPCs or bosses leaving you quite incapable of doing much unless you have an SMG equipped.**</mark> The extra bit of bleed proc being dished out won't really do anything special but maybe slightly annoy the zombies you're hitting with this some more.

The Hitman's Heatmaker is an interesting sniper rifle in base TF2 that allows players to rapidly headshot with its "Focus" ability active. This is gained through kills and assists and will let players headshot without unscoping.&#x20;

This can be very strong in Zombie Escape by allowing players to rapidly stun zombies with successive headshots without having to worry about timings for firing after scoping in if you want to shoot as fast as you can. This is a great utility for continually focus-firing on groups of zombies, albeit it does make a tracer shot in focus mode _(so they might try to actively dodge more once they see it.)_ Since that is this weapon’s main niche, its damage output is lessened, dealing...

* 50 damage on 0%-charged bodyshots
* 150 damage on fully-charged bodyshots
* 600 initial damage on headshots
* With a 30% faster reload rate, this can deal \~140 DPS with nonstop, 0%-charged shots
* \~110 DPS with nonstop, fully-charged shots.

Since headshot kills are so important, their role in Zombie Escape encourages this due to the increased headshot damage of \~1200 via the plugin, making it a good tool to tunnel in on Zombie Item users or particularly dangerous zombies - but you should be doing that with any rifle really. **Body-shots with this weapon will&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**deal 0 damage,**</mark>**&#x20;meaning that you cannot body-shot to knockback a zombie whilst fleeing!**

_(A few maps here and there might give Zombies healing items or upwards of a base \~50K HP, rendering the whole gimmick of the weapon pointless if you can't actually claim a head.)_

In regards to DPS, this can deal up to:

* \~3 DPS with nonstop, 0%-charged shots
* \~100 DPS with nonstop, fully-charged shots and no charge boost
* &#x20;\~250 DPS with nonstop, fully-charged shots and a full charge boost

It's a weapon meant to make Snipers good enough at landing their shots, with the added bonus of increased DPS should they kill enough zombies.

* 60 damage on 0% charge bodyshot
* 180 on fully charged bodyshot
* 1200 on fully-charged headshot
* \~200 nonstop full-charge DPS

At the cost of rapidly stunning, this remains as a decent pick for boss-fights by reaching \~200 nonstop full-charge DPS while granting you greater field-of-view without having to scope-in.
