Outshined by the SMG in vanilla TF2, the Cleaner's Carbine turns the tables in ZE. SMGs, in general, are a nice utility for a Sniper to space themselves from zombies if they get too close or to hold them off in a corner. Alternate from a headshot to pushing back with an smg over and over and you can stall for a long time. Well, assuming you're up against a single zombie. The _significantly smaller clip size_ compared to the stock SMG is actually overshadowed by the mini-crits, which allows you to push back even further. You can even time it well enough to knock zombies back into kill/teleport triggers or when you need just that _extra_ bit of damage to take out a low zombie.

## SMG   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_SMG (1).png>)

With an extremely large clip size, you can find yourself shooting at zombies for a long time with the SMG. However, its biggest downside is the longer reload speed. With the fast paced nature of ZE, longer reloads might prove fatal if you get caught too close to a zombie when out of ammo. That \~0.9 second difference between this and the Cleaner's Carbine in reload times do, well, _make a difference_. At least one other upside to the SMG is allowing you to focus at shooting bosses more with less interruptions from the amount of times you have to reload. You will be sacrificing damage _unless_ the boss is damaged based on bullets hit. If so, this makes it one of the strongest boss killers due to its very short attack interval.\


## Jarate   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Jarate.png)

Jarate is the type of item you toss at zombies both with and without care just because you can, but does reward aiming it into larger herds of them. Having several zombies coated in it allows your team to push back slightly more due to mini-crits. This could help in areas where you can knock zombies off platforms into kill/teleport triggers or when they're starting to push a bit too hard and the collective effort of the team will make more of an impact than you alone with an smg. The minicrits, however, are not as impactful as they are in vanilla TF2. The cooldown time is quite long enough to make you want to make you want to pick when to use it selectively, such as aiming it for Zombie Teleports that you know of. The slow time will falter stuff like Heavy Enzymes pretty significantly too, or allow you to get in some more headshots in while they are slowed.

## Cozy Camper   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Cozy\_Camper.png)

| Attributes                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+4 Health Regenerated per Second on Wearer**</mark>   |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Knockback Reduced by 20% when Aiming**</mark>       |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**No flinching when aiming and fully charged**</mark> |

The Cozy Camper is specifically for healing from zombie mutation damage without having to rely on a healing source. Given how plentiful healing is and that you're a backline specialist, this almost never comes into play - though sniper primaries are at least damaging enough to make them work in place of an SMG.

## Darwin's Danger Shield   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Darwin's\_Danger\_Shield.png)

| Attributes                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+50% Fire Damage Resistance on Wearer**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Immune to the effects of afterburn.**</mark> |

The afterburn from Pyro Mutations is not much of a threat considering how plentiful healing is. If your team has no healing, shouldn't you be running Jarate to save yourself _and_ your team anyway? Or you know, an actual class that can heal?

## Razorback   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Razorback.png)

| Attributes                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-100% maximum overheal on wearer.**</mark>               |
| <mark style="color:red;">**\[Supposed to] block a single backstab attempt.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:red;">**This item does not work as intended.**</mark>            |

A backstab from a Zombie Spy does not even count as a backstab as it does 300 damage on hit instead. So, yes, the weapon stats you'll see in-game is a lie. Truly the only weapon that has zero upside and actively hurts you for having it equipped. The only reason worth using it is _if you're playing as a Zombie Sniper_, as then it does function proper.
