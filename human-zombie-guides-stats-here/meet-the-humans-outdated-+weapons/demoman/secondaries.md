With the shorter arm time and quicker firing speed, the Quickiebomb Launcher lets the Demoman make traps much quicker and allow him to play **much** more aggressive. Using the Quickie for traps usually isn't a bad idea if you have downtime, but you'll likely better utilize it up front by launching (and charging) 3/4 of your stickies; the last one serving as an imminent cover if needed be.

What the weapon excels in _over stock_ is the functionality dishing out stuns en masse due to the increased charge damage _(and being able to reach that full charge within little over a second);_ a fully charged quickie sticky can **reliably** lock down large clusters of zombies due to it being able to reach the damage cap required for a stun much more reliably; _and_ any stickies that aren't working on temporarily stun-immune zombies will still slow them down upon taking damage.

All at the cost of only being halved a clip compared to alternatives, and some less baseline (uncharged) sticky damage. What that means is your uncharged stickies will be far less likely to stun a zombie that you need to slow or hinder; leaving you a little more vulnerable at the frontlines if you just try to panic spam them like stock.

Boasting the shortest reload time, the Stickybomb Launcher allows Demoman to excel extremely well at his biggest strength of fallback stalling. The Stickybomb Launcher provides the best uptime out of all his secondaries thanks to its reload speed, allowing him to space out his stickies on paths the zombies have to go to slow them down and even potentially stun them. It also still functions well in defending purposes, providing enough stickies to stun any dangerous threats like Heavies or pop Pyros before their Mutations reach the team.

The fully charged bonus is a way for players to make more of an impact with sticky traps without having to greatly change the general damage modifiers; note that gaining more damage from charging will mean that zombies will be able to get stunned (and slowed) in clusters far more reliably by a charged sticky; but the time in itself is a little too long to invest doing it for every sticky. _Best to save that job for Quickie unless you have a lot of time on a defense to shoot out charged stickies._

Do note that while zombies do have stun immunity momentarily and that your sticky at full charge will fire just in time to re-stun the same zombie - it might be better as a whole to _forego_ the mechanic on this by spamming (uncharged) stickies on masses of zombies to stun the ones that _haven't_ been recently stunned yet; you'll still apply slowdown to the ones already resistant to stun anyway.

With an ability to have two more pipebombs out, the Scottish resistance allows Demoman to stun dangerous zombies much quicker during defenses (pre-emptively.) While it could be better at defending, you have to remember that stunned zombies take no knockback; so if stunned too close they could pose a threat, but otherwise like all the other stickies its an excellent method of stalling. The much slower arm bomb time means you have preemptively plant stickies on fallbacks forcing you to play much more passively. The ability to trigger stickies only when you look at them _does_ allow you to cover multiple paths at once.

With the increase in Charge recharge rate stat, the Splendid Screen allows Demoman to act as a Demoknight to block and tank zombie hits more often than the other shields making this the best shield out of the 3 in utility. Keep in mind _**any**_ damage from a zombie will trigger the uber proc - be it a stray medic enzyme chipping you for -4 HP or one of the many pyro enzymes, so you might lose it randomly!

For more aggressive Demoknights, the melee kills refilling 75% of your charge meter can be very helpful if you're consistently killing Heavies or Pyros using their Mutations. The inconsistency of the ÜberCharge activating despite being quickly recharged after you kill a zombie does make this less reliable than the Splendid Screen.

While the Chargin' Targe does boast the highest resistance, the most relevant thing the resistances affect is the afterburn and explosion damage from Pyro Mutations, which is barely a threat in most cases. Having no other redeemable qualities than that makes it the least ideal out of the 3 available shields.

The Sticky Jumper in Zombie Escape works similarly to the Rocket Jumper. This weapon subverts expectations by instead being able to deal massive damage to both enemeies and oneself. This can lay out 2 stickybombs that can deal massive damage. However, understand that the attack cycle for this weapon is comparably slow to the other stickybomb launchers at \~4 seconds with no charge or \~8 seconds using full charge. Additionally, it will take around \~2 seconds for stickies to activate after firing.

Its main movement denial mechanic remains as its stunning ability; in spite of not being able to lay out many stickies, this weapon still has the 2nd highest sticky trap damage. This makes this an easier weapon to utilize for setting up sticky traps on bosses but less strong as a defensive weapons throughout the duration of a map.

Due to it being immensely setup heavy and the amount of penalties such as movement decrease & weapon switches being hindered; the weapon doesn't exactly get far on stall-heavy defenses _(which is kind of exactly where Demoman excels best in AoE stun-spams and slow)_; thus leaving it in just about a similar state of being semi-joke weapon, much akin to the Rocket Jumper.
