## Stickybomb Launcher   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Stickybomb\_Launcher (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                            |

Boasting the shortest reload time, the Stickybomb Launcher allows Demoman to excel extremely well at his biggest strength of fallback stalling. The Stickybomb Launcher provides the best uptime out of all his secondaries thanks to its reload speed, allowing him to space out his stickies on paths the zombies have to go to slow them down and even potentially stun them. It also still functions well in defending purposes, providing enough stickies to stun any dangerous threats like Heavies or pop Pyros before their Mutations reach the team.

## Scottish Resistance   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Scottish\_Resistance (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                            |

With its increased firing speed and ability to have much more pipebombs out, the Scottish resistance allows Demoman to stun dangerous zombies much quicker during defenses. While it could be better at defending, you have to remember that stunned zombies take no knockback so stunning zombies during defenses is not as strong as you think - and can potentially be dangerous if stunned too close. The much slower arm bomb time means you have preemptively plant stickies on fallbacks forcing you to play much more passively. The ability to trigger stickies only when you look at them does allow you to cover multiple paths at once.

## Quickiebomb Launcher   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Quickiebomb\_Launcher (1).png>)

With the shorter arm time and quicker firing speed, the Quickiebomb Launcher lets the Demoman make traps much quicker and allow him to play much more aggressive. By putting 3/4 stickies, you're easily able to stun a group of zombies since it'll hit the damage threshold to stun them. However, you typically want to space out your stickies as that will increase the amount of time zombies will be slowed by explosives. Zombies will eventually get stunned by stickies further ahead making quick sticky traps a bit pointless when you want to elongate a stall. **Note:** Charging stickies will up their damage output - which in turn will _increase stun radius_, allowing you to net in easier stuns!

| <mark style="color:yellow;">**When you would be damaged by a zombie, consume a full charge bar to instead gain \~1 second of ÜberCharge. Requires a full charge bar to activate.**</mark> |

With the increase in Charge recharge rate stat, the Splendid Screen allows Demoman to act as a Demoknight to block and tank zombie hits more often than the other shields making this the best shield out of the 3 in utility. Keep in mind _**any**_ damage from a zombie will trigger the uber proc - be it a stray medic enzyme chipping you for -4 HP or one of the many pyro enzymes, so you might lose it randomly!

| <mark style="color:yellow;">**When you would be damaged by a zombie, consume a full charge bar to instead gain \~1 second of ÜberCharge. Requires a full charge bar to activate.**</mark> |

For more aggressive Demoknights, the melee kills refilling 75% of your charge meter can be very helpful if you're consistently killing Heavies or Pyros using their Mutations. The inconsistency of the ÜberCharge activating despite being quickly recharged after you kill a zombie does make this less reliable than the Splendid Screen.

While the Chargin' Targe does boast the highest resistance, the most relevant thing the resistances affect is the afterburn and explosion damage from Pyro Mutations, which is barely a threat in most cases. Having no other redeemable qualities than that makes it the least ideal out of the 3 available shields.

The sticky jumper provides a larger explosion radius over the other stickybomb picks and the quickest reload time; unfortunately it currently can't do any stuns for the moment (one of the more important mechanics of playing demo - leaving it even lower than having a shield pick for the moment.
