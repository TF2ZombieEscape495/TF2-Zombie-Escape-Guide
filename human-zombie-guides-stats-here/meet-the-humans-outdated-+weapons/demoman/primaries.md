For the moment _before any imminent nerfs to the weapon inevitably happen_ - the loose cannon currently lets you charge and shoot what appears as regular pill - and still can self-damage for overcharging it of course, but that's not just all.

The loose cannon reliably nets in some _insanely_ high damage for Demoman on both masses of zombies and bosses that aren't bullet-counters, will shred down any pesky zombie item users' HP or ones at nearly full enzyme - and provides one of the largest crowd control slows if you're landing every shot. ~~_Oh and if you love point-farming, the damage values from this on a full server will really let you show off._~~

The Iron Bomber is simply a more reliable primary compared to the stock Grenade Launcher. While you might slow fewer zombies down with the reduced explosion radius, the shorter fuse time and less bounce and roll of grenades let your rollers more consistently slow large groups of zombies down. These types of grenades don't really launch zombies very much, so you can worry less about boosting zombies into your team.

The Grenade Launcher is nearly identical to the Iron Bomber aside from the physical grenade properties. It can be a good alternative if you prefer a larger explosion radius over the consistency of rollers from the Iron Bomber. But, you can more easily boost with this, so be careful!

Favoring direct hits, the Loch-N-Load lets the Demoman more consistently slow zombies, at the cost of losing rollers and being a less effective weapon. It also loses out on actually being able to damage most NPCs and bosses as well!
