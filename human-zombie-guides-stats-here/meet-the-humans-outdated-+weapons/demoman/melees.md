# Melees

## Pain Train   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Pain\_Train (1).png>)

| Attributes                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**+10% Bullet Bamage Vulnerability on Wearer**</mark>     |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**When Held: +10% Faster Move Speed on Wearer**</mark>   |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: +20% Damage Vulnerability on Wearer**</mark> |

Movement is valued in ZE, so it's no surprise the Pain Train is at the top of Demoman's melees. The Pain Train alleviates his movement speed nerf, thus providing the best utility out of all his melees. It's even the favored weapon for Demoknights, as the ÜberCharge upon receiving a hit offsets the damage vulnerability that the Pain Train inflicts. The only downside is the lack of extended range the Demoman's swords and axe may have, but you'll more than likely wind up getting hit by getting too close to the zombies anyway.

## Bottle   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Bottle.png)

While the extra range from swords is nice, the switch speed ultimately hinders them, as most scenarios where you want to pull out your melee are when you have to quickly react to a Heavy using their Mutation. This makes the Bottle more valuable than the swords.

## Claidheamh Mòr   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Claidheamh\_Mòr.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**0.5 sec increase in charge duration**</mark>                                 |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Melee kills refill 25% of your charge meter.**</mark>                        |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**This Weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower**</mark> |

If you prefer the longer range of the swords when playing Demoknight while having the most utility, then the Claidheamh Mòr is the weapon for you. It has the bonus of having a longer charge for safer fallbacks while giving you a nice bonus for killing low-HP zombies compared to the other swords. Although, having more speed from the Pain Train would help you fall back just as much. Be careful with the damage vulnerability and surrounding sources of damage. It shouldn't matter too much for melee hits due to the Über-on-hit if you have full shield charge.

## Persian Persuader   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Persian\_Persuader.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-80% Max Primary Ammo on Wearer**</mark>                                        |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-80% Max Secondary Ammo on Wearer**</mark>                                      |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Melee hits refill 0% of your charge meter.**</mark>                          |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">**Ammo boxes collected give Charge**</mark>                                    |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower**</mark> |

The downsides and upsides are basically negligible as you're mainly using the Persian Persuader for the extra range. You also won't be encountering many situations where ammo boxes will fall into ideal places for you to pick them up, even if you want to fill up your Charge.

## Half-Zatoichi   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Half-Zatoichi (2).png>)

| Attributes                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower**</mark>           |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Honorbound: Once drawn sheathing deals 50 damage to yourself unless it kills.**</mark> |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Gain 0% of base health on kill**</mark>                                                |

You don't always get the kill from a Heavy using their Mutation or a low zombie before you need to swap weapons, so the Half Zatoichi is a sword with a relatively small downside. Though one-shotting Soldier and Demo zombies using this weapon as well is pretty satisfying.

## Scotsman's Skullcutter   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Scotsman's\_Skullcutter.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:blue;">**+20% Damage Bonus**</mark>                                                     |
| <mark style="color:red;">**When Held: -15% Slower Move Speed on Wearer**</mark>                            |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower**</mark> |

While you won't have your Scotsman's Skullcutter out all the time, the slowdown is exacerbated by the fact that Demoman is already the slowest class. In the event you want to play Demoknight, you'll be moving at a crawl. Remember that melee damage is useless as meleeing Heavies using their Mutations are unaffected by melee damage bonuses.

## Eyelander   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Eyelander.png)

| Attributes                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-25 Max Health on Wearer**</mark>                                               |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**Cannot gain heads!**</mark>                                                  |
| <mark style="color:orange;">**This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower**</mark> |

Dreams of speeding through the map faster than a Scout with the BFB after killing 4 Heavies are unfortunately only a fantasy due to the Eyelander's inability to collect heads. The -25 max health can prove detrimental over time due to the damage you are bound to accumulate.

## Ullapool Caber   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/100px-Item\_icon\_Ullapool\_Caber.png)

| Attributes                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">**-20% Slower Firing Speed**</mark>        |
| <mark style="color:red;">**This weapon deploys 100% slower**</mark> |

The Ullapool Caber once used to be completely unmodified, leading to very funny moments when a Demoman could one-shot a group of zombies with the Last Man Standing melee buffs. Sadly, this weapon has been severely nerfed to the point where that isn't a possibility anymore. The slower firing speed and longer deployment time make this a hassle to use for even taking out low zombies.
