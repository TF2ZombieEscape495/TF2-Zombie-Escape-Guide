# Class Loadouts (Medic/Sniper/Spy)

## Medic

Most of Medic's gameplay will revolve around constantly healing his teammates. Certain map situations will make it such that it may be better to change your primary for more effective healing.

### General Healer

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/General Healer Loadout (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Syringe Gun/Blutsauger**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Medi Gun/Kritzkrieg**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Amputator/Solemn Vow**</mark>

\
This is the most common loadout you'll have for Medic. There isn't any specific Medi Gun that you should need, as it will be very map-dependent or situation-dependent on what you may want to use. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Syringe Gun**</mark> is Medic's best, and actually one of the strongest overall, weapons for defending and stalling; and the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Blutsauger**</mark> will allow you to unleash your inner battle medic to keep the team tidied up without even beaming them. You won't be using a primary all the time if you're switching between beaming teammates. \
\
The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Vita-Saw**</mark> will provide small buffs to your ubercharge mechanics via charge rate and duration - while the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Solemn Vow**</mark> will provide more raw, overall healing through your beam - both are pretty interchangeable depending on what you need more in your playstyle.

### Burst Healer

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Burst Healer Loadout (2).png>)

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Crusader's Crossbow**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Quick-Fix**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Solemn Vow**</mark>

\
This is similar to the above loadout except that you'll have the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Crusader's Crossbow.**</mark> You'll be lacking vastly in defensive and have **zero boss damage** capability, but the Crusader's Crossbow serves as a form of AoE healing, albeit within a line. There is a large amount of health gained on hit plus you can shoot teammates far away if outside of Medi Gun range.&#x20;

Use this to capitalize on certain map elements or to safeguard straying teammates. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Solemn Vow**</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">**and Quick-Fix**</mark> combo mostly capitalizes on rapidly healing someone that might be targeted by a boss or is in taking repeated amounts of damage that a crossbow can't cover on time.

### Pocket Healer

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Pocket Healer (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Overdose**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Vaccinator**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Solemn Vow/Vita-Saw**</mark>

This one falls less in line with supporting the entire team and instead puts you into a role of specifically pocketing important overdefenders against crowds of large zombies. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Overdose**</mark> will let you outpace most classes so having your uber topped up with the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Vita-Saw's**</mark> build rate can help keep it ready to flee from the frontlines. As for the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Solemn Vow**</mark> (yet again), it can assist the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Vaccinator's**</mark> heal rate on any overdefender vs zombie enzyme chip damage. This can be used to prepare anyone taking boss aggro by giving them a  larger overheal than other mediguns.

## Sniper

### Ranged Stall & Stunner

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Ranged Staller and Stunner Loadout (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Sniper Rifle/Hitman's Heatmaker/Bazaar Bargain**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cleaner's Carbine/SMG**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Kukri/Bushwhacka**</mark>

Sniper's inherent potential is behind making headshots. In the long run, the damage dealt with headshots will remain insignificant unless zombies are low on health or once your damage scales up. The main appeal is the stun. With targeted stuns, you can stall zombies from any distance. Time it well enough to even save teammates about to be hit by zombies. Play the class smart to be a nuisance at range and in close quarters if you're confident enough.\
\
For secondary weapons, you'll mostly want to consider SMGs for defending and stalling. The stock SMG has a huge clip and a fast firing speed for bosses that are based on bullet-count. However, the Cleaner's Carbine stalls and defends even better with its mini-crits. You'll be a mini Heavy! For melee weapons, it won't matter too much, so feel free to equip the Kukri or use the Bushwhacka to kill off jarated zombies or your team if you get infected.

### Boss Assist Sniper

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Boss Assist Sniper (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Classic/Machina**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cozy Camper/SMG**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Kukri**</mark>

With this loadout, the cozy camper's lack of (flinching) can allow you to stay scoped in to land those beefy <mark style="color:yellow;">**Machina**</mark> shots - _nearly_ the equivalent of a Heavy's DPS. Although the self-healing won't be entirely useful if the boss disables that mechanic; it's a nice niche for specific maps like the boss being dead and no more healing sources are around to top you up for the finale.&#x20;

You'll be outright useless on DPS checks that prevent scope-ins (laser bosses) if you aren't packing a choice of <mark style="color:yellow;">**SMG**</mark> ~~_(or can't land your shots against zombies lmao idiot)_~~ - which the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Classic**</mark> evens out by being able to roll in some damage without scope-ins hindering your sightline on specific boss attacks.

### Point Farmer

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Point Farmer.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Sydney Sleeper**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Jarate**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Bushwhacka**</mark>

One may notice that Sniper gains a lot of points after repeatedly headshotting. If you're the type to snipe well and care about points, you'll be at the top of the leaderboards for sure. Just combine it with playing smartly to make the most of the class.&#x20;

But, you're point farming... so why bother? Slap on Jarate with whatever melee you have. **Aim your **<mark style="color:yellow;">**Jarate**</mark>** at zombie teleports** and gain points through assisted damage to see funny numbers grow bigger, jarated zombies are passively _slowed down_ too so you can get an easier headshot in; as well as denies them from hopping around a corner at full speed with a zombie item or enzyme at the ready. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Sydney Sleeper**</mark> can't directly deal stuns from headshots but can at least lower the <mark style="color:yellow;">**(60s) cooldown**</mark> of your jarate to spam it again.

## Spy

### Triggerer & Boss Support

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Triggerer And Boss Killer Loadout.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Revolver/Enforcer**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Sapper**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Knife**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Dead Ringer**</mark>

\
Most of the time, it'll be too dangerous to go for backstabs, especially if the zombies are smart enough to actually look out for you. Instead, why not play it safe and take care of any NPCs or bosses so your team doesn't die? You can get the triggers as well. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Revolver**</mark> having one of the high-ends of DPS against NPCs/Bosses, with the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Enforcer**</mark> taking the throne; albeit some more financed use on getting it to work as you need to use the disguising on that to actually work out that extra damage.

You can use the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Sapper**</mark> for a tiny bit of extra speed when held out. To trigger _even faster_, use the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Dead Ringer**</mark> to gain speed boosts upon taking damage, likely through falls. Your knife won't matter too much as long as it's not the Big Earner with its health debuff, but it won't hurt to use the best option of stock.

### Gun-Spy Dopamine

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Diamondback Dopamine.png>)

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Diamondback**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Red Tape Recorder**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Knife**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Dead Ringer**</mark>

Want to feel less of a selfish pick to the team when you're playing Spy? The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Diamondback**</mark> will effectively <mark style="color:red;">**lock you out of your disguise kit**</mark> and penalize you with a large movement debuff for holding _anything_ but the gun out. On the bright side though, this is one of the Spy's best defense tools; as it has a extra bullets per shot and can amass critical hit bursts upon diamondback kills for <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[10] seconds**</mark> worth of extra knockback and damage - this doesn't come to be very practical on maps with high zombie HP values; but excellent against zombie teams that have one too many zombie pyros bombing or items that can lower this value greatly; provided your team doesn't steal the kill. The overall DPS of this loadout doesn't hold up as well as stock, but it's still a fun pick.

### Aggressive Backstabber

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Aggressive Backstabber (ALT) Loadout.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**L'Etranger**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Red Tape Recorder**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Spycicle/Knife/Your Eternal Reward**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cloak And Dagger**</mark>

\
Once you've decided to go a class dependent on melee to be effective in a game mode where zombies will oneshot you with melees of their own, it's time to just go all in. You'll be reliant on backstabs to ease the pressure on the team, so play it smart and give yourself as much leverage as possible.&#x20;

Use the <mark style="color:yellow;">**L'Etranger**</mark> for its extra cloak duration _(evening out the penalty of cloak and dagger)_ to grant yourself more time to sneak in or escape. Use the stock Knife if you don't want any gimmicky stab mechanics. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Spycicle**</mark> will offer you extended melee ranged for those that are more experienced in trickstabbing, albeit can be punished more on miss. As for the <mark style="color:yellow;">**YEW;**</mark> it does more damage on bacsktab - which can be janky depending on map-specific zombie health, but will let you at least take out zombie item users maybe.

Finally to top it all off, the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cloak and Dagger's**</mark> niche in this situation is that it grants extra base health - so you'll be able to tank at least one more hit if you don't run into bad weapon matchups or get double-tagged on your way out from zombie backlines.

_As long as you play it smart, this type of Spy will be a great asset to the team—assuming you don't die the first minute into the round._ \
