# Class Loadouts (Medic/Sniper/Spy)

## Medic

Most of Medic's gameplay will revolve around constantly healing his teammates. Certain map situations will make it such that it may be better to change your primary for more effective healing.

### General Healer

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* Syringe Gun/Blutsauger
* Medi Gun/Quick-Fix/Kritzkrieg
* Amputator/Solemn Vow

\
This is the most common loadout you'll have for Medic. There isn't any specific Medi Gun that you should need, as it will be very map-dependent or situation-dependent on what you may want to use. The Syringe Gun is Medic's best, and actually one of the strongest overall, weapons for defending and stalling; and the Blutsauger will allow you to unleash your inner battle medic to keep the team tidied up without even beaming them. You won't be using a primary all the time if you're switching between beaming teammates. ~~Of course, the Amputator will be there in case the team needs AoE healing, like off pyro enzymes or before a boss starts.~~

### Burst Healer

_**Loadout:**_

* Crusader's Crossbow
* Kritzkrieg
* Vita-Saw

\
This is similar to the above loadout except that you'll have the Crusader's Crossbow. You'll be lacking vastly in defensive and damage power, but the Crusader's Crossbow serves as a form of AoE healing, albeit within a line. There is a large amount of health gained on hit plus you can shoot teammates far away if outside of Medi Gun range. Use this to capitalize on certain map elements or to safeguard straying teammates. The Vita-Saw and Kritz combo mostly capitalizes on farming up those crits with a quicker recharge time and extended duration.

### Pocket Healer

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Pocket Doorhugger.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Overdose
* Quick-Fix/Vaccinator
* Solemn Vow/Vita-Saw

This one falls less in line with supporting the entire team and instead puts you in a more of a doorhugging role in maps that may have high damage NPCs. The Overdose will let you outpace most classes so having your uber topped up with the vita-saw's build rate can help. As for the solemn vow, it comes in line well with the quick-fix for areas that won't let you stay still and can help make up for the vaccinator's slow heal rate; provided you can flick a beam across teammates well. On a final note, this loadout works well to tidy up people being hard-aggroed by bosses with <mark style="color:green;">**healing**</mark> enabled.

## Sniper

### Ranged Stall & Stunner

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Ranged Staller and Stunner Loadout (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* Sniper Rifle/Hitman's Heatmaker/Bazaar Bargain
* Cleaner's Carbine/SMG
* Kukri/Bushwhacka

Sniper's inherent potential is behind making headshots. In the long run, the damage dealt with headshots will remain insignificant unless zombies are low on health or once your damage scales up. The main appeal is the stun. With targeted stuns, you can stall zombies from any distance. Time it well enough to even save teammates about to be hit by zombies. Play the class smart to be a nuisance at range and in close quarters if you're confident enough.\
\
For secondary weapons, you'll mostly want to consider SMGs for defending and stalling. The stock SMG has a huge clip and a fast firing speed for bosses that are based on bullet-count. However, the Cleaner's Carbine stalls and defends even better with its mini-crits. You'll be a mini Heavy! For melee weapons, it won't matter too much, so feel free to equip the Kukri or use the Bushwhacka to kill off jarated zombies or your team if you get infected.

### Boss Assist Sniper

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Boss Assist Sniper (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* Classic/Machina
* Cozy Camper
* Kukri

With this loadout, the cozy camper's lack of (flinching) can allow you to stay scoped in to land those beefy Machina shots - _nearly_ the equivalent of a Heavy's DPS. Although the self-healing won't be entirely useful if the boss disables that mechanic; it's a nice niche for specific maps like the boss being dead and no more healing sources are around to top you up for the finale. You'll be outright useless on DPS checks that prevent scope-ins (laser bosses) if you aren't packing a choice of SMG ~~_(or can't land your shots against zombies lmao idiot)_~~ - which the Classic evens out by being able to roll in some damage without scope-ins hindering your sightline on specific boss attacks.

### Point Farmer

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Point Farmer.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* Sydney Sleeper
* Jarate
* Bushwhacka

One may notice that Sniper gains a lot of points after repeatedly headshotting. If you're the type to snipe well and care about points, you'll be at the top of the leaderboards for sure. Just combine it with playing smartly to make the most of the class.&#x20;

But, you're point farming... so why bother? Slap on Jarate with whatever melee you have. **Aim your Jarate at zombie teleports** and gain points through assisted damage to see funny numbers grow bigger, jarated zombies are passively slowed down too so you can get an easier headshot in; as well as denies them from hopping around a corner at full speed with a zombie item or enzyme at the ready. Sydney sleeper can't directly gain points from headshots but can at least lower the <mark style="color:yellow;">**(60s) cooldown**</mark> of your jarate to spam it again.

## Spy

### Triggerer & Boss Support

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Triggerer And Boss Killer Loadout.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* Revolver/Enforcer
* Sapper
* Knife
* Dead Ringer

\
Most of the time, it'll be too dangerous to go for backstabs, especially if the zombies are smart enough to actually look out for you. Instead, why not play it safe and take care of any NPCs or bosses so your team doesn't die? You can get the triggers as well. The Revolver having one of the high-ends of DPS against NPCs/Bosses, with the Enforcer taking the throne; albeit some more financed use on getting it to work as you need to use the disguising on that to actually work out that extra damage.

You can use the Sapper for a tiny bit of extra speed when held out. To trigger _even faster_, use the Dead Ringer to gain speed boosts upon taking damage, likely through falls. Your knife won't matter too much as long as it's not the Big Earner with its health debuff, but it won't hurt to use the best option of stock.

### Gun-Spy Dopamine

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Diamondback Dopamine.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Diamondback
* Red Tape Recorder
* Knife
* Dead Ringer

Want to feel less of a selfish pick to the team when you're playing Spy? The Diamondback will effectively <mark style="color:red;">**lock you out of your disguise kit**</mark> and penalize you with a large movement debuff for holding _anything **but**_ the gun out. On the bright side though, this is one of the Spy's best defense tools; as it has a extra bullets per shot and can amass critical hit bursts upon diamondback kills for <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[10] seconds**</mark> worth of extra knockback and damage - this doesn't come to be very practical on maps with high zombie HP values; but excellent against zombie teams that have one too many zombie pyros bombing or items that can lower this value greatly; provided your team doesn't steal the kill. The overall DPS of this loadout doesn't hold up as well as stock, but it's still a fun pick.

### Aggressive Backstabber

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Aggressive Backstabber (ALT) Loadout.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

_**Loadout:**_

* L'Etranger
* Red Tape Recorder
* Spycicle/Knife/Your Eternal Reward
* Cloak And Dagger

\
Once you've decided to go a class dependent on melee to be effective in a game mode where zombies will oneshot you with melees of their own, it's time to just go all in. You'll be reliant on backstabs to ease the pressure on the team, so play it smart and give yourself as much leverage as possible.&#x20;

Use the L'Etranger for its extra cloak duration _(evening out the penalty of cloak and dagger)_ to grant yourself more time to sneak in or escape. Use the stock Knife if you don't want any gimmicky stab mechanics. The Spycicle will offer you extended melee ranged for those that are more experienced in trickstabbing, albeit can be punished more on miss. As for the YEW; it does more damage on bacsktab - which can be janky depending on map-specific zombie health, but will let you at least take out zombie item users maybe.

Finally to top it all off, the Cloak and Dagger's niche in this situation is that it grants extra base health - so you'll be able to tank at least one more hit if you don't run into bad weapon matchups or get double-tagged on your way out from zombie backlines.

_As long as you play it smart, this type of Spy will be a great asset to the teamâ€”assuming you don't die the first minute into the round._ \
