# Human Meta Discussion (OUTDATED) (+Loadouts!)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Human Strategies.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**PSA:**</mark> hi if you're on this page and somehow didn't get the memo from the title, much of these meta playstyles and loadouts are out of date across the board on the Human Meta subsection;

The _most likely outcome_ scenario will be to kill all textwall segments and re-do them from scratch & just update the loadouts.\

{% endhint %}

Sure the team _can_ go 40 Snipers all with jarate and throw piss at the zombies but it's nowhere near as effective as simply maxing out on Heavies on a difficult map. We'll talk about how to play each class, some of the more advanced strategies that you can do to improve your gameplay, things to watch out for, and meta discussions; **(**[**ideal**](class-loadouts-scout-soldier-pyro/) [**weapon**](class-loadouts-demoman-heavy-engineer/) [**loadouts!**](class-loadouts-medic-sniper-spy/)**)**

Despite all of this, remember that the game is meant to be for fun and that you shouldn't force people to play the way you want them to play as most people will typically do their own thing! Take it easy!
