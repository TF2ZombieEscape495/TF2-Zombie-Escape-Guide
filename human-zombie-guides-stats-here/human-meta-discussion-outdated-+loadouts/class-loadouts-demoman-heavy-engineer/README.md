# Class Loadouts (Demoman/Heavy/Engineer)

## Demoman

### AoE Staller

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/AOE STaller2 Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Grenade Launcher//Loose Cannon/Iron Bomber
* Stickybomb Launcher/Quickiebomb Launcher/Scottish Resistance
* Pain Train

\
The Demoman's primary job is to AoE stall and slow. His main tool for this is his Stickybomb Launcher, which despite firing slower than the Quickiebomb Launcher and not having as many stickies as the Scottish Resistance, deals enough damage for the stun threshold while being simpler to use. The Scottish Resistance can be more preferable if the map doesn't require as much stalling or you simply want to point farm thanks to its faster firing speed and ability to denotate individual bombs. The Iron Bomber may be a bit more desirable than the Grenade Launcher to avoid boosting, but so long as you land direct hits you'll be able to stall without worry. Most important for this class in general will be the Pain Train to make up for how detrimentally slow Demoman is.

### Demoknight

_**Loadout:**_

* Grenade Launcher/Iron Bomber
* Splendid Screen
* Pain Train/Claidheamh Mòr

\
Now why would you ever consider this playstyle? You're sentencing yourself to death at every moment you try to play to its niche. Sure, you can use the launchers to slow a bit, but the ièce de résistance for this job ain't there. As such, this style takes up a very unique niche of handling Heavy Mutations and bodyblocking, particularly in closed quarters or doorways. With a shield and a full charge, you will be Übered on hit from zombies. The Pain Train will help with speed overall but the Claidheamh Mòr will give you that boost in range to take out zombies at a safer distance. In almost all cases, this playstyle is of very little use and can only be worth consideration on rare occasions per map layout.

## Heavy

### Main Defender

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Main Defender Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Minigun/Brass Beast/Natascha
* Shotgun
* Warrior's Spirit/Gloves of Running Urgently



Heavy is one of the most powerful defenders in TF2 ZE. He's a slow class at base, so using the GRU will help a lot in that regard. During long holds or boss fights, the Brass Beast will prove far stronger with its high damage and fire rate so long as you understand how to maneuver yourself from its long rev time, but if the long deploy isn't favorable; then Minigun or Natascha fit just as well. Use the stock Shotgun for falling back or to grant some emergency spacing if zombies catch up. The Warrior's Spirit will keep you topped off while the GRU can help you catch up to teammates when held out.&#x20;

### &#x20;Versatile Heavy

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/versatile heavy.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Tomislav
* Family Business/Dalokah's Bar
* Eviction Notice

This one's a little unique to the table in the regard that this setup will base itself around passive movement and the rapid deploy of the Tomislav, letting you get up close and personal before you flee - coupling this up with the Family Business; this loadout can provide Heavy a much stronger damage output to bosses or NPCs while on the run without committing to a rev-up. Also depending on whether or not you opted into the Dalokah's bar, the extra HP can offset _\[most]_ zombie weapon one shots; almost _neutralizing_ the passive penalty of the Eviction Notice. You'll effectively be down a secondary if there's any laser bosses on the latter, but the Tomislav is pretty reliable at delay defenses if you aren't completely alone!

## Engineer

### Supportive Defender

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Supportive Defender Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Frontier Justice
* Short Circuit
* Southern Hospitality/Jag/Wrench/Gunslinger

\
As an Engineer, much of his support will come from Dispensers and Mini-sentries. There are a wide variety of melees to choose from that will impact how they'll be set up and managed. In the end, so long as you have them slapped down somewhere to benefit the team, you're golden. Use the Short Circuit's M2 bolts to help with fallbacks as it has a large area of effect for slowing down hordes of zombies. The Frontier Justice can be used to hold them back on defenses or for stalling when running, and provides some higher-end DPS to NPCs on the way.

### Boss Assist

### ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Boss Assist Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Frontier Justice
* Wrangler
* Wrench/Jag

When fighting certain bosses, you may have the luxury of receiving healing from dispensers. So long as there's some healing provided, it can be very beneficial. As such, you may want to equip the Wrench and Wrangler to maximize the dispenser range for a larger healing radius, or the Jag to deploy dispensers within seconds if you're the only engineer left. If the boss you're fighting against nerfs/disables healing, you can settle for better utility secondaries and melees over the two mentioned. The Frontier Justice's higher DPS over the Shotgun can greatly lessen the time taken to kill the boss resulting in a quicker fight and potentially less deaths.

### Sentinel Engineer

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Blockader Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Rescue Ranger
* Wrangler
* Eureka Effect

Being able to set up buildings that only your team can phase through, it makes sense that you'd want to use them as some sort of blockade. They aren't tanky enough to be reliable on their own, requiring you to constantly repair them, which the Jag can help with. If you want to get more out of Mini-sentries, use the Wrangler shield to help them absorb more damage, and increase their build time significantly. Alternatively, you can stay away and repair from afar with the Rescue Ranger. This type of playstyle is fairly niche and is for maps with doorways and narrow hallways, but does show utility from time to time in stopping Heavy Mutations and ÜberCharge zombies.\
