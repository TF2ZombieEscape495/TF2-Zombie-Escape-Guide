# Class Loadouts (Demoman/Heavy/Engineer)

## Demoman

### AoE Staller

<div align="left">

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Grenade Launcher/Loose Cannon/Iron Bomber**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Stickybomb Launcher/Quickiebomb Launcher**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Pain Train**</mark>

\
The Demoman's primary job is to AoE stall and slow. His main tool for this through sticky detonation slowdowns and stun-locks. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Loose Cannon**</mark> may be a bit more desirable than the other Grenade Launchers to avoid boosting, but so long as you land direct hits you'll be able to stall without worry. Most important for this class in general will be the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Pain Train**</mark> to make up for how detrimentally slow Demoman is.

### Point-Farmer Demoman

<div align="left">

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Loose Cannon**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Scottish Resistance**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Pain Train**</mark>

Ever wanted to see your scoreboard numbers go up up up? This one's the go-to, especially for tight corridor-heavy maps like SCP, Outlast, OBJ - and possibly a few more; paired with a Kritz pocket-medic you'll see some funny numbers.&#x20;

Okay but really, the general niche of this build is that it heavily excels in denying these types of areas by either repeatedly leaving timed <mark style="color:yellow;">**Scottish**</mark> stickies across several fallback points or spamming them into a chokepoint like any other projectile - the slight viability in leaving stunning stickies on a split route in case its lost to zombies to buy people more time for fallbacks is also there.

### Demoknight

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Grenade Launcher/Iron Bomber**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Splendid Screen**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Pain Train/Claidheamh Mòr**</mark>

\
Now why would you ever consider this playstyle? You're sentencing yourself to death at every moment you try to play to its niche. Sure, you can use the launchers to slow a bit, but the ièce de résistance for this job ain't there.&#x20;

As such, this style takes up a very unique niche of **handling Heavy Mutations** and **bodyblocking**, particularly in closed quarters or doorways. With a shield and a full charge, you will be Übered on hit from zombies.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**The Pain Train**</mark> will help with speed overall to make your fallbacks safer, as well as _beating even faster classes like Scouts_ to map items in the right conditions **via charging.**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Claidheamh Mòr**</mark> will give you that boost in range to take out zombies at a safer distance. In almost all cases, this playstyle is of small use and can only be worth consideration on rare occasions per map layout.

## Heavy

### Main Defender

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Main Defender Loadout.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Minigun/Brass Beast/Natascha**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Shotgun/Family Business**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Warrior's Spirit/Gloves of Running Urgently**</mark>

Heavy is one of the most powerful defenders in TF2 ZE. He's a slow class at base, so using the <mark style="color:yellow;">**GRU**</mark> will help a lot in that regard. During long holds or boss fights, the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Brass Beast**</mark> will prove far stronger with its high damage and fire rate so long as you understand how to maneuver yourself from its long rev time, but if the long deploy isn't favorable; then Minigun or Natascha fit just as well. Use the stock <mark style="color:yellow;">**Shotgun/Family Business**</mark> for falling back or to grant some emergency spacing if zombies catch up. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Warrior's Spirit**</mark> will keep you topped off before or after a boss while the <mark style="color:yellow;">**GRU**</mark> can help you catch up to teammates when held out.&#x20;

### &#x20;Versatile Heavy

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/versatile heavy.png>)

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Tomislav**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Family Business/Dalokah's Bar**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Eviction Notice**</mark>

This one's a little unique to the table in the regard that this setup will base itself around passive movement and the rapid deploy of the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Tomislav,**</mark> letting you get up close and personal before you flee - coupling this up with the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Family Business;**</mark> this loadout can provide Heavy damage output to bosses or NPCs on the run **without committing to a rev-up.**&#x20;

Also depending on whether or not you opted into the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Dalokah's bar**</mark>, the extra HP can offset _\[most]_ zombie weapon one shots; almost _neutralizing_ the <mark style="color:red;">**passive penalty**</mark> of the Eviction Notice. You'll effectively be down a secondary if there's any laser bosses on the latter, but the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Tomislav**</mark> is pretty reliable at delay defenses if you aren't completely alone!

## Engineer

### Supportive Defender

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Supportive Defender Loadout (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Frontier Justice**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Short Circuit**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Southern Hospitality**</mark>

\
As an Engineer, much of his support will come from Dispensers and Mini-sentries. There are a wide variety of melees to choose from that will impact how they'll be set up and managed. In the end, so long as you have them slapped down somewhere to benefit the team, you're golden. Use <mark style="color:yellow;">**Short Circuit's**</mark> M2 bolts to help with fallbacks as it has a large area of effect for slowing down hordes of zombies. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Frontier Justice**</mark> can be used to hold them back on defenses or for stalling when running, and provides some higher-end DPS to NPCs on the way. Lastly, the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Southern Hospitality's**</mark> passive movement upgrade will allow you to manuever maps much more fluidly.

### Boss Assist

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Boss Asssist Engineer.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Frontier Justice**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Wrangler**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Wrench**</mark>

When fighting certain bosses, you may have the luxury of receiving healing from dispensers. So long as there's some healing provided, it can be very beneficial. As such, you may want to equip the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Wrench**</mark> **and** <mark style="color:yellow;">**Wrangler**</mark> to maximize the dispenser range for a larger healing radius.

If the boss you're fighting against nerfs/disables healing, you can settle for better utility secondaries and melees over the two mentioned. The <mark style="color:yellow;">**Frontier Justice's**</mark> higher DPS over the Shotgun can greatly lessen the time taken to kill the boss resulting in a quicker fight and potentially less deaths.

### Sentinel Engineer

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Blockader Loadout.png>)

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rescue Ranger**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Wrangler**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Eureka Effect**</mark>

Being able to set up buildings that only your team can phase through, it makes sense that you'd want to use them as some sort of blockade. They aren't tanky enough to be reliable on their own, requiring you to constantly repair them. If you want to get more out of Mini-sentries, use the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Wrangler**</mark> shield to help them absorb more damage, and increase their build time significantly. Alternatively, you can stay away and repair from afar with the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rescue Ranger**</mark>. This type of playstyle is fairly niche and is for maps with doorways and narrow hallways, but does show utility from time to time in stopping Heavy Mutations and ÜberCharge zombies.

### Rapid Deployer

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Rapid Deployment Engi Loadout.png>)

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rescue Ranger/Widowmaker**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Wrangler**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Jag**</mark>

Technically this niche could fit into either Support or Boss; but the primaries alone bring a much different playstyle; focusing more on placing buildings like door-blockade sentries and dispensers as quickly as possible before you move into the next area - the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Widowmaker**</mark> here in particular with precision shots will offer very long uptimes of shots against zombies. Basically the go-to loadout for tight, hectic maps.
