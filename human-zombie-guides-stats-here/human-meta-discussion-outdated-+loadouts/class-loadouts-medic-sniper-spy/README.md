# Class Loadouts (Medic/Sniper/Spy)

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note**</mark> **that some of these medic & sniper loadout suggestions are now dated and might need another touch-up later! (**_**Stuff like amputator being weaker due to 64 players changes...)**_
{% endhint %}

## Medic

Most of Medic's gameplay will revolve around constantly healing his teammates. Certain map situations will make it such that it may be better to change your primary for more effective healing.

### General Healer

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/General Healer Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Syringe Gun/Blutsauger
* Medi Gun/Quick-Fix/Kritzkrieg
* Amputator

\
This is the most common loadout you'll have for Medic. There isn't any specific Medi Gun that you should need, as it will be very map-dependent or situation-dependent on what you may want to use. The Syringe Gun is Medic's best, and actually one of the strongest overall, weapons for defending and stalling; and the Blutsauger will allow you to unleash your inner battle medic to keep the team tidied up without even beaming them. You won't be using a primary all the time if you're switching between beaming teammates. ~~Of course, the Amputator will be there in case the team needs AoE healing, like off pyro enzymes or before a boss starts.~~

### Burst Healer

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Burst Healer Loadout.png>)\
_**Loadout:**_

* Crusader's Crossbow
* Medi Gun/Quick-Fix/Kritzkrieg
* Amputator

\
This is similar to the above loadout except that you'll have the Crusader's Crossbow. You'll be lacking vastly in defensive and damage power, but the Crusader's Crossbow serves as a form of AoE healing, albeit within a line. There is a large amount of health gained on hit plus you can shoot teammates far away if outside of Medi Gun range. Use this to capitalize on certain map elements or to safeguard straying teammates.&#x20;

### Pocket Healer

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Pocket Doorhugger.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Overdose
* Quick-Fix/Vaccinator
* Solemn Vow/Vita-Saw

This one falls less in line with supporting the entire team and instead puts you in a more of a doorhugging role in maps that may have high damage NPCs. The Overdose will let you outpace most classes so having your uber topped up with the vita-saw's build rate can help. As for the solemn vow, it comes in line well with the quick-fix for areas that won't let you stay still and can help make up for the vaccinator's slow heal rate; provided you can flick a beam across teammates well. On a final note, this loadout works well to tidy up people being hard-aggroed by bosses with <mark style="color:green;">**healing**</mark> enabled.

## Sniper

### Ranged Stall & Stunner

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Ranged Staller and Stunner Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Sydney Sleeper/Sniper Rifle/Machina/Hitman's Heatmaker
* Cleaner's Carbine/SMG
* Kukri/Bushwhacka

Sniper's inherent potential is behind making headshots. In the long run, the damage dealt with headshots will remain insignificant unless zombies are low on health or once your damage scales up. The main appeal is the stun. With targeted stuns, you can stall zombies from any distance. Time it well enough to even save teammates about to be hit by zombies. Play the class smart to be a nuisance at range and in close quarters if you're confident enough.\
\
For secondary weapons, you'll mostly want to consider SMGs for defending and stalling. The stock SMG has a huge clip and a fast firing speed for bosses that are based on bullet-count. However, the Cleaner's Carbine stalls and defends even better with its mini-crits. You'll be a mini Heavy! For melee weapons, it won't matter too much, so feel free to equip the Kukri or use the Bushwhacka to kill off jarated zombies or your team if you get infected.

### Point Farmer

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Point Farmer.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Sniper Rifle/Hitman's Heatmaker/Sydney Sleeper
* Jarate
* Kukri/Bushwhacka

One may notice that Sniper gains a lot of points after repeatedly headshotting. If you're the type to snipe well and care about points, you'll be at the top of the leaderboards for sure. Just combine it with playing smartly to make the most of the class. But, you're point farming... so why bother? Slap on Jarate with whatever melee you have. Aim your Jarate at zombie teleports and gain points through assisted damage to see funny numbers grow bigger, jarated zombies are passively slowed down too so you can get an easier headshot in. Sydney sleeper can't directly gain points from headshots but can at least lower the <mark style="color:yellow;">**(60s) cooldown**</mark> of your jarate to spam it again.

## Spy

### Triggerer & Boss Killer

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Triggerer And Boss Killer Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Revolver
* Sapper
* Knife
* Dead Ringer

\
Most of the time, it'll be too dangerous to go for backstabs, especially if the zombies are smart enough to actually look out for you. Instead, why not play it safe and take care of any NPCs or bosses so your team doesn't die? You can get the triggers as well. The Revolver having one of the highest DPS of all class weapons can help with this, and you can use the Sapper for a tiny bit of extra speed. To trigger _even faster_, use the Dead Ringer to gain speed boosts upon taking damage. Your knife won't matter too much as long as it's not the Big Earner with its health debuff, but it won't hurt to use the best option of stock.



### Gun-Spy Dopamine

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Diamondback Dopamine.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Diamondback
* Red Tape Recorder
* Knife
* Dead Ringer

Want to feel less of a selfish pick to the team when you're playing Spy?The Diamondback will effectively <mark style="color:red;">**lock you out of your disguise kit**</mark> and penalize you with a large movement debuff for holding _anything **but**_ the gun out. On the bright side though, this is one of the Spy's best defense tools; as it has a extra bullets per shot and can amass critical hit bursts upon diamondback kills for <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[10] seconds**</mark> worth of extra knockback and damage - this doesn't come to be very practical on maps with high zombie HP values; but excellent against zombie teams that have one too many zombie pyros bombing or items that can lower this value greatly; provided your team doesn't steal the kill. The overall DPS of this loadout doesn't hold up as well as stock, but it's still a fun pick.

### Aggressive Backstabber

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Aggressive Backstabber Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* L'Etranger
* Red Tape Recorder
* Knife/Big Earner/Kunai
* Dead Ringer/Invis Watch

\
Once you've decided to go a class dependent on melee to be effective in a game mode where zombies will oneshot you with melees of their own, it's time to just go all in. You'll be reliant on backstabs to ease the pressure on the team, so play it smart and give yourself as much leverage as possible. Use the L'Etranger for its extra cloak duration to grant yourself more time to sneak in or escape. Use the stock Knife or the Big Earner if you need a cloak on kill at the cost of extra HP. The Invis Watch can help sneak in, but the safest play may be the Dead Ringer to help with the escape and sticky situations. The L'Etranger will _also_ allow for you to sneak around more as you don't get blink-revealed upon bumping. As long as you play it smart, this type of Spy'll be great asset to the teamâ€”assuming you don't die the first minute into the round.\
