# \[OPTIMAL DPS] + Team Comps

### Optimal DPS: Easy to Use!

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Easy 2 Use DPS.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>cba to edit the image but note that Flare + Direct Hit can be pretty interchangeable with Reserve Shooter (or) Stock Shotgun for more consistency on bosses that Flares/Rockets won't hit, bullet counters, etc</p></figcaption></figure>

Some maps will have bosses scaled to the point where they will kill you _**always**_ before you can kill them. Times like these are for when you go all-in on the damage. The top 4 damaging classes that have the most consistency are **Heavy, Engineer, Spy, and Scout,** though all of the others are brought up here for comparison between one another.

In most cases, these weapons provide the easiest use to squeeze out that higher end spectrum of DPS _**(without learning a weird gimmick or niche to the weapon that might otherwise lower your DPS for not using it the proper way or get you killed.)**_

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Scouts**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Scattergun**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/scout/primaries.md#scattergun) **\[170 DPS]&#x20;**_**(or**_ [_**Shortstop**_](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/scout/primaries.md#shortstop) _**\[160 DPS] if full clip reload is hard to focus; during lasers...)**_
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Soldiers**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Direct Hit**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/soldier/primaries.md#direct-hit) **\[191 DPS]&#x20;**_**(or choice of**_ [_**Shotgun**_](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/soldier/secondaries.md#reserve-shooter) _**if bullet-based or hard to land hits.)**_
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Pyros**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Flare Gun**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/pyro/secondaries.md#flare-gun) **\[160 DPS]&#x20;**_**(or choice of**_ [_**Shotgun**_](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/pyro/secondaries.md#reserve-shooter) _**if bullet-based or hard to land hits.)**_
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Demomen**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Iron Bomber**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/demoman/primaries.md#iron-bomber) **\[159 DPS] or** [**Grenade Launcher**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/demoman/primaries.md#grenade-launcher) **\[159 DPS.]**
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Heavies**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Minigun**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/heavy/primaries.md#minigun) **\[320 DPS.]**
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Engineers**</mark>**&#x20;will want the** [**Frontier Justice**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/engineer/primaries.md#frontier-justice) **\[190 DPS.]**&#x20;
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Medics**</mark>**&#x20;will want the** [**Syringe Gun**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/medic/primaries.md#syringe-gun) **\[182 DPS.]**
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Snipers**</mark>**&#x20;can use either the** [**SMG**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/sniper/secondaries.md#smg) **\[170 DPS] or** [**Cleaner's Carbine**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/sniper/secondaries.md#cleaners-carbine) **\[170 DPS.]**
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Spies**</mark>**&#x20;will want to have the** [**Revolver**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/spy/primaries.md#revolver) **\[171 DPS.]**

### **Max DPS: Harder to Use**

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Harder 2 Use DPS.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Note that [Pyro/Engineer/Medic] already have their -best- weapon DPS go-to's listed in the previous optimal list.</p></figcaption></figure>

Many of these weapons stray into the territory of having a major negative downside; <mark style="color:red;">**high risk high reward type weapons**</mark> that _in the right hands_, can really push that extra chunk of DPS needed **before** timing out on a boss or having the team wipe to a specific attack.

Attached to most of these suggestions are dumbed down descriptive notes that explain why the weapon <mark style="color:red;">**might be harder for the average person to pick up on the fly**</mark> when seeking the most optimal damage-dealing methods under their mechanics.

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Scouts**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Force-A-Nature**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/scout/primaries.md#force-a-nature) **\[200 DPS]**&#x20;
  * _Large spread, movement de-buff and vulnerability on user for holding out._&#x20;
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Soldiers**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Rocket Jumper**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/soldier/primaries.md#rocket-jumper) **\[200 DPS]**&#x20;
  * _Weapon may kill user via splash, nearly impossible to hit moving targets with, insanely vulnerable on defenses with this out._
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Demomen**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Loose Cannon**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/demoman/primaries.md#loose-cannon) **\[192 DPS]**
  * _User may cause self-damage via overcharging shot during bosses that don't allow healing. Can allow demoman to damage bosses that pills might normally bounce off, via timed splash damage._
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Heavies**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Brass Beast**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/heavy/primaries.md#brass-beast) **\[380 DPS]**
  * _User must hard commit to rev-ups on defense, risky to deploy if bosses can push or pull you off arena._
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Snipers**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Machina**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/sniper/primaries.md#machina) **\[300 DPS]**
  * _User must commit to a full scope-in for 5 second intervals; suspectible to many boss attacks like Brass Beast is._
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Spies**</mark>**&#x20;can use the** [**Enforcer**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/spy/primaries.md#enforcer) **\[191 DPS]**
  * _**User must repeatedly fully equip a disguise between firing shots for efficient DPS output; may lead to poor DPS if timing isn't precise.**_

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note:**</mark> 64 players has changed a lot about TF2 ZE's flow in terms of team comps - but everything here is still relevant in terms of what you'll want in a team; albeit just think of it as inflated, higher numbers now. Heavies and Engineers are still capped to (8) total slots.
{% endhint %}

Just like in regular TF2, a good team composition is necessary to beat the other team or, in this case, the maps themselves. Having a team of Snipers for something like Dustbowl or 2fort never bodes well. Here it is... actually decent? Here are some things to consider regarding the number of classes in a team; some may be expected, and some may be surprising.

## Main Points

* You generally want max (8) Heavies
* A couple healing sources (3-4) from Medics and Engineers are helpful; Concheror and Mad Milk can work just as well.
* A few (2-3) Pyros for stalling is very helpful.
* A few (2-3) dedicated Spy and Scout triggerers is fine.
* Really only need a few (2-3) specialist classes (e.g. Soldier, Demoman, Sniper, Spy) for certain niches like stunning or killing zombies and other various supports.
* Remaining slots should try to fill the above **from top to bottom.**

## Full Team Compositions

### The General Case

For almost all maps, this type of team will work well. The first class you might want to stack is **Heavies**. You'll always want Heavies for their high DPS, survivability, and high rate of fire. Aside from that, a few triggerers like Scouts or Spies can help rush things along.&#x20;

Sources of healing are crucial to deal with Mutation spam, so Medics and Engineers are very helpful for that role. For safety, a few Pyros can stall zombies when falling back with the addition of a couple Demos to further bolster the stall. A pair of Soldiers with Concheror can be extremely useful so you can consistently get buffed by the Concheror's effects; so long as they're chaining it one after another.

#### ~~Sniper Gaming~~

~~Sniper is the best class, not the bias of one of the original writers of this guide. Totally not. Not even a class cap can restrict their power, allowing as many Snipers as you want on the team. If zombies were to spawn with 50k HP and you had 27 Snipers, it'll take roughly two headshots from each Sniper to shut them down. If they can't aim, well, wait for one of your good Snipers to stun them so that the rest can gang up on them while they can't move. Even if they can't headshot, Cleaner's Carbine is a good choice for pushing encroaching zombies back. And what about healing? Who needs it.~~

## Meta Discussion

Leading into the next pages here with this one; unlike in CS ZE, TF2 ZE has classes that each have their unique strengths and weakness. Unfortunately, some classes are much stronger in power level compared to the other classes. This makes stacking certain stronger classes over other weaker classes more beneficial. In this next segment, **classes are labelled under how Vanilla TF2 categorizes each class;**&#x20;

* **`Scout Soldier Pyro in Offense`**
* **`Demoman Heavy Engineer in Defense`**
* **`Medic Sniper Spy in Support`**\
