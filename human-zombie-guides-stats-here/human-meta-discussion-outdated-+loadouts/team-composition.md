# Team Composition



{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note:**</mark>_ 64 players has changed a lot about TF2 ZE's flow in terms of team comps - but everything here is still relevant in terms of what you'll want in a team; albeit higher numbers.
{% endhint %}

Just like in regular TF2, a good team composition is necessary to beat the other team or, in this case, the maps themselves. Having a team of Snipers for something like Dustbowl or 2fort never bodes well. Here it is... actually decent? Here are some things to consider regarding the number of classes in a team; some may be expected, and some may be surprising.

## Main Points

* You generally want max (8) Heavies
* A couple healing sources (3-4) from Medics and Engineers are helpful; Concheror and Mad Milk can work just as well.\
  A few (2-3) Pyros for stalling is very helpful.
* A few (2-3) dedicated Spy and Scout triggerers is fine.
* Really only need a few (2-3) specialist classes (e.g. Soldier, Demoman, Sniper, Spy) for certain niches like stunning or killing zombies and other various supports.
* Remaining slots should try to fill the above **from top to bottom.**

## Full Team Compositions

### The General Case

For almost all maps, this type of team will work well. The first class you might want to stack is Heavies. You'll always want Heavies for their high DPS, survivability, and high rate of fire. Aside from that, a few triggerers like 1 or 2 Scouts or Spies can help rush things along. Sources of healing are crucial to deal with Mutation spam, so Medics and Engineers are very helpful for that role. For safety, a few Pyros can stall zombies when falling back with the addition of 1 or 2 Demos to further bolster the stall. 2 Soldiers with Concheror can be extremely useful so you can consistently get buffed by the Concheror's effects.

### Max DPS

Some maps will have bosses scaled to the point where they will kill you _**always**_ before you can kill them. Times like these are for when you go all-in on the damage. The top 4 damaging classes are Heavy, Engineer, Spy, and Scout.&#x20;

If not much movement is required;&#x20;

* **Heavies can use the** [**Brass Beast**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/heavy/primaries.md#brass-beast)**.**
* **Engineers will want the** [**Frontier Justice**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/engineer/primaries.md#frontier-justice)**.**&#x20;
* **Spies will want to have the** [**Revolver**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/spy/primaries.md#revolver)**.**
* **Scouts should use the** [**Back Scatter**](../meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/scout/primaries.md#back-scatter)**.**&#x20;

Aside from these classes, you'll be restricted to only a few assuming _everybody_ follows along. Use these slots for a Medic or two for healing and a Pyro if you need some sort of stalling.

#### ~~Sniper Gaming~~

~~Sniper is the best class, not the bias of one of the original writers of this guide. Totally not. Not even a class cap can restrict their power, allowing as many Snipers as you want on the team. If zombies were to spawn with 50k HP and you had 27 Snipers, it'll take roughly two headshots from each Sniper to shut them down. If they can't aim, well, wait for one of your good Snipers to stun them so that the rest can gang up on them while they can't move. Even if they can't headshot, Cleaner's Carbine is a good choice for pushing encroaching zombies back. And what about healing? Who needs it.~~\


## Meta Discussion

Leading into the next pages here with this one; unlike in CS ZE, TF2 ZE has classes that each have their unique strengths and weakness. Unfortunately, some classes are much stronger in power level compared to the other classes. This makes stacking certain stronger classes over other weaker classes more beneficial. In this next segment, **classes are labelled under how Vanilla TF2 categorizes each class;**&#x20;

* **`Scout Soldier Pyro in Offense`**
* **`Demoman Heavy Engineer in Defense`**
* **`Medic Sniper Spy in Support`**\
