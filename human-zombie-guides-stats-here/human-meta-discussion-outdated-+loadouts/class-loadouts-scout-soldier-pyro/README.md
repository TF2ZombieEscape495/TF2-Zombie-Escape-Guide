# Class Loadouts (Scout/Soldier/Pyro)

## Scout

### Trigger Scout

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Trigger Scout Loadout.png" alt="" data-size="original">

_**Loadout:**_

* Back Scatter/Baby Face's Blaster (BFB)
* Pistol/Winger/Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol(PBPP)/Bonk! Atomic Punch
* Bat/Wrap Assassin/Sun-on-a-Stick/Fan O'War

\
This sort of playstyle revolves around doorhugging and getting triggers _as fast as possible._ With the BFB, you can shoot the zombies at the start of the round to obtain maximum boost. Since the BFB lacks DPS, you can use pistols if you're forced to shoot NPCs or if you need to help stall the zombies. The Winger loses out to the pistol and PBPP in DPS but makes up for it with a better reload speed. Bonk! Atomic Punch can also achieve this effect while sacrificing the DPS of a pistol. It can also help your teammates fall back after triggering. Since you'll primarily be doorhugging, any scout melee is fine, aside from the Sandman, which has an HP penalty.

### Support Scout

_**Loadout:**_

* Back Scatter/Shortstop
* Bonk! Atomic Punch/Mad Milk
* Bat/Wrap Assassin/Sun-on-a-Stick/Fan O'War\


Typically, there only needs to be 1 or 2 people to get triggers, so you may be better off defending or at least stalling rather than doorhugging. Scout may not be the greatest defender compared to other classes like Heavy or Pyro, but he more than makes up for it with his utility of being able to boost his team with Bonk! Atomic Punch or effectively counter Pyro and Medic Mutations with Mad Milk. Options such as the backscatter may provide for a good cover, though not all too accurate with its spread; at least you're netting in some really high DPS with it equipped. If you wish to defend at a much safer distance, the Shortstop might be preferable with its tighter spread.

### Glass Cannon

_**Loadout:**_

* Force-A-Nature
* Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol/Winger
* Bat/Wrap Assassin/Sun-on-a-Stick/Fan O'War

The reason this earns the namesake of Glass Cannon - The Force-A-Nature is the **best** Scout primary at _defending_ and will primarily be using a secondary but it puts you at high risk of getting caught fleeing with its <mark style="color:red;">**huge movement penalty.**</mark> This loadout is is practically going to be placing you in the frontlines against zombie's faces if you want it at its prime; ramps, ledges, and shorter backpedals. Best that it be paired with a preferable cover pistol like the Winger to swiftly dispatch any zombie on you or your teammates tail, or get some health on hit with the P.B.P.P. Keep in mind the FAN is going to give you a 33% universal damage vulnerability when held out too, so zombies can one shot you even _with_ the mad milk's HP bonus - not an ideal pairing really. A solid pick for those that want to do a little more than just pinch zombies as a scout.

## Soldier

### Support Soldier

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Support Soldier Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Liberty Launcher/Cow Mangler
* Buff Banner/Battalion's Backup/_<mark style="color:green;">**Concheror**</mark>_
* Pain Train

\
You might be wondering why Concheror is bolded, italicized, and <mark style="color:green;">**green**</mark>. Frankly, this is the only reason why Soldier is considered good in ZE. The ability to boost your team with a speed buff and give your team lifesteal is tremendously powerful. Alternatively, you could use the Buff Banner for minicrits to help hold positions or the Battalion's Backup to give a team-wide damage resistance that works on ALL sorts of damage, including NPCs and bosses.\
\
As for primaries, Soldier has two options. The Liberty Launcher has the special attribute of having the rocket specialist upgrade from MvM. Although damage from weapons already slows and knockbacks, it is extremely effective at countering Heavy Mutations as a direct hit prevents them from moving while using it. You can also use the Cow Mangler to charge banners more easily while having less downtime due to its extremely fast reload. The Pain Train is really the only viable melee for Soldier for its speed buff when held out.

## Pyro

### Main Staller

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Main Staller Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout**_

* Flame Thrower/Degreaser/Dragon's Fury
* Shotgun
* Powerjack

\
The generic way of playing Pyro is to be in the frontlines, slowing down zombies with your flames while airblasting every now and then for spacing. Just remember not to spam airblasts due to the airblast resistance zombies will build up. Unlike some of the other classes, Pyro's loadout choices are very static since his less powerful weapons simply get outclassed by the top choices. The only choice you need to make is between the Flamethrower and the Degreaser.\
\
The Degreaser is more useful for dealing with Heavy Mutations since you'll be up close and personal with them naturally. It'll allow you to swap to melee faster to hit them before they hit you. The Flame Thrower is a better choice for longer stalls and defenses to conserve ammo from airblasts. The Dragon's Fury can be very useful against less zombies as the slow from the zombies is greater than that of the other two flamethrowers. The Shotgun is Pyro's most reliable secondary weapon, allowing him to defend beyond the range of his flamethrower while also damaging NPCs and bosses. The Powerjack is the only Pyro melee that has some form of utility and, as such, is the only one worth using in most cases.

### One Off Push

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/One-off Push2 Loadout.png>)

_**Loadout:**_

* Backburner
* Detonator
* Powerjack

\
A more reserved playstyle for Pyro, you can use the Backburner's increased airblast force to push a large group of zombies, typically off edges or into TPs. This tremendous push force is at the cost of making them take up **over half** of your maximum ammo reserves on use. As a result, you won't be able to use even more than one airblast consecutively unless several dispensers are stacked up for your leisure. Once again, it would be best to just have the Powerjack for speed. While waiting for the Backburner to recharge, the Detonator can be used as a form of mini-airblast (with the right angling it can _also_ fling zombies off edges) and delay certain zombies enough in instances where you wouldn't risk getting close enough with your flames; though does need a bit more timing to get used to.
