# Common Items

Items may differ map-to-map and in purpose, yet one may notice some that are repeatedly used across several maps. _For example_, Final Fantasy maps tend to share common items that may accomplish similar things. Of course, variations may still be present like a gravity item on one map not having as strong a pull or having a different area of effect versus another. This section simply details some of the shared common items.

## Human Items

<table><thead><tr><th width="189">Item</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Fire</strong></td><td>An AoE fire that damages and slows zombies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Electro</strong></td><td>An AoE lightning that damages and slows zombies. It tends to be weaker than other items but may occasionally damage bosses</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wind</strong></td><td>Pushes zombies around or in front of you. Typically follows you or stays in one spot. It has a tendency to boost zombies when not used in a narrow choke point</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gravity</strong></td><td>Summons a vortex that sucks zombies inside of it and traps them for a few seconds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ice/Snow/Freeze</strong></td><td>Drastically reduce zombies' speed while potentially damaging them in an AoE</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Earth</strong></td><td>Summons a giant wall that can be used to block zombies or your team</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Water</strong></td><td>Usually pushes zombies upwards while slowing them down</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ammo</strong></td><td><a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">Does nothing</a>/Gives Crits in an AOE/Infinite clip for duration of item</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heal</strong></td><td>Heals in an AoE and is <strong>especially important</strong> for boss fights. May or may not follow you. Can sometimes grant temporary invulnerability to zombies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trace/Mimic</strong></td><td>Uses the effect of the most recently used item</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ultima</strong></td><td>A one time use item that <em>takes time</em> to execute after activation. Usually kills zombies in a massive AoE.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Zombie Items

<table><thead><tr><th width="190">Item</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Gravity</strong></td><td>Sucks in nearby humans near you, causing them to be in melee range</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Warp/Nuke</strong></td><td>Instantly kills humans nearby you</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heal</strong></td><td>Sets the hp of you and zombies around you to a certain amount, may occasionally cause you to lose health as a result</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage</strong></td><td>Deal damage to humans nearby you, usually resulting in their death if they're still in your AoE</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Confuse</strong></td><td>Heavily obstructs human vision - enough to nearly blind or obstruct them for map hazards or zombie pressure</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Freeze/Slow</strong></td><td>Does as the name would imply, slows Humans down with a projectile or AoE to catch up to them and swarm upon</td></tr></tbody></table>





[^1]: This only really does nothing in some of the older ported maps (like Shroomforest) due to differences in CS and TF2 ammo mechanics
