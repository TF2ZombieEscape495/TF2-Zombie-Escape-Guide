# Parkour

## Blocks

Pretty simple, these are just areas where you might find yourself jumping from one block to another. These can be stationary, moving, etc.

## Ladders

TF2 doesn't have ladders built into the game, so these are implemented via plugins. As a result, they will more than likely feel janky to climb. If you ever find yourself stuck on a part of the ladder, try strafing left and right while trying to move up. You have to keep moving forward while looking up to climb and you can climb down by looking down. Ladders will automatically attempt to cling you to them on their own. As a zombie, you can hold space to force yourself upwards if humans are shooting down on you.

## Boost Pads

These are fun to use, but might also be jank. It's dependent on the mapper as to how these are implemented and how a player should use them. Some might launch you a certain direction, some might just float you upwards, some might boost you horizontally, etc.

## Other Variants

There is a whole bunch of stuff not covered. Below show some other things, but that and everything previously shown are just the tip of the iceberg.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of the parkour you'll encounter will be relatively harmless, merely a means to an end of moving section to section. However, most of the time they'll come with a catch such as <mark style="color:red;">**instakill**</mark> triggers below them if you fail, sections where the zombies can rush you if you fall, or obstacles that damage you as you run into them. Some might be avoidable, whereas some are less so. You might even have to parkour for triggers. If having issues with it, try the **`/hideteam`** command to remove your teammates' player models from your vision while you move around. It has the added benefit of allowing you to render less objects on your screen for a potential boost in fps if you need it for making any tight jumps.
