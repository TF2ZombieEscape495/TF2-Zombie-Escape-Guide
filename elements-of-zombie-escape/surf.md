# Surf

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYc52kwTNb8" %}
_"I thought this was a Zombie Escape guide, why are you talking about surf?"_ This section is to make people aware that, on a few maps, you will have to surf to survive. This isn't a guide on how to surf, however, so one of us has done the liberty of googling how to surf and copy and pasting the first video that appears. No need to thank 'em of course.

## Still, give me a TLDR

Alright, assuming the typical **`W,A,S,D format`** (you can translate it to your respective keybinds):

If going down a slope, hold the key that would push you onto the side of the slope you're on (e.g. for a slope on your left, hold **A**). For the most part, **do not hit W or S as they will more than likely negatively affect your momentum** unless you know what to do. Move your mouse in the direction of curves in smooth motions. Unplanned erratic movements will lead to you losing all momentum. Sliding down slopes will help you gain momentum and flicking up at the end of ramps will give you more height. This will all take some practice if you're completely new, so feel free to refer to the video above and practice where you can.

## I don't want to surf. :( Why is it in Zombie Escape?

Since most ZE maps currently in TF2 are from CS, it follows that surf would stake a presence. When used sparingly, their inclusion may break up the monotony of simple routes you walk to-and-from. Whilst used extensively, they act as trim sections to bolster the zombie side and filter out humans until they learn the surf. This is evident with more and more maps nowadays making surf their primary motif. Hate it or love it, it's almost inevitable that you're going to encounter a surf section somewhere.
