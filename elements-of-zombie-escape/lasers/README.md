# Lasers

These are the ultimate test of reflexes and the ultimate form of needlessly trimming most of the Human team. The reason is that lasers will, on most occasions, outright kill you if you touch them. Lasers will appear on a bunch of maps, and it's best you get used to and learn how to dodge them if you wish to survive. If you want to reduce the visual clutter of your teammates in order to focus, try typing **`/hideteam.`**

Much like parkour, you'll encounter different types of lasers. Frequent types and how to dodge them are discussed below. Of course, the shape of these lasers will also vary across maps.

## Horizontal

These are the most common type of lasers and are fired at you parallel to the ground. When you see a high laser that's aimed at your head, crouch. When you see a laser aimed at your knee caps, be sure to jump. When you see a laser aimed right at your waist, be sure to crouch jump. Sometimes, it'll be hard to differentiate between them all, so that will have to come down to experience with the map.\


{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note**</mark>: _**Crouch-jumping**_ is used as a common misnomer for _jumping then holding crouch_ while in the air - not to be confused with the act of _jumping while crouched_ like in CS. You can't do this in TF2.

## Vertical

These are also fairly simple lasers that are commonly fired at you perpendicular to the ground. They are usually 90 degrees to the floor but can, much like other things, vary according to the mapper. To dodge these, you will have to strafe left or right.

## Diagonal

These lasers are like Horizontal lasers but angled so that they are not parallel to the ground. You can usually dodge them by jumping over one side or crouching on the other. Alternatively, you might be able to jump-crouch over them in the middle. This is necessary for situations where two lasers of opposite angles are stacked on top of each other and fired at you.

## Top-down & Bottom-up

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/TopDownBottumUpLasers.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These lasers are fired at you from above and/or from below. You have to strafe left and right while looking up or down to dodge. Since you can make relatively small steps much more easily while looking up or down, expect most of these lasers to be fired in close proximity to one another. It'll be a test of both reflexes _and_ precision.

## Spinner

These lasers will rotate while being fired at you. They may rotate parallel or perpendicular to the ground. Since they're spinning, you will have to "read" their rotation and dodge appropriately. Be extra careful with ones parallel to the ground as, depending on their rotation or move speed, you may initially dodge one end of the laser but be hit by the other end as it turns.
