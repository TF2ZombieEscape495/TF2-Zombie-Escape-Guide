Despite the simple premise of shooting zombies and running, this guide is fairly long. There's a lot of nuance and things that might not reveal themselves to you at first. There are **new weapon stats**, **map strategies**, **difficulty levels**, **team coordination**, and _a slew of other changes_. It's overwhelming! The first and foremost thing is to have fun, of course. Get lost in the atmosphere, enjoy the weird people around you, and have fun shooting zombies.

The sections of this guide that will be most relevant to you will be the following.&#x20;

### **\<This Section>**

[**Meet The Humans**](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/)

[**Meet The Zombies**](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-zombies/)

[**Elements of ZE** ](broken-reference)

[**Where to Play**](where-to-play.md)

The rest of it? Well... don't sweat it! You can learn as you go or feel free to read up on it if you want. This guide is meant for anybody interested in the game mode, so there will be _**a lot**_ of information provided for reference. If you're new, take things leisurely and just have fun at your own pace :).
