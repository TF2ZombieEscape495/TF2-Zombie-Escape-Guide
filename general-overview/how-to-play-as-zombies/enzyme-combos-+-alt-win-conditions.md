  Why limit yourselves to mutations of the same nature when there are a whole
  bunch of different classes to work with?

# Niche Mechanic Uses

## Combining Enzymes

This is a bit harder to coordinate, but the results can feel even more satisfying. For example, Sniper's Jarate Mutation will coat the Human team in piss, allowing you to deal more damage. This is applied to explosive damage, allowing Pyros to explode and deal more damage. Another example involves Soldier's smokescreen. Used alone, it doesn't pose much of a threat. Combine it with a Pyro Mutation or Heavy ready to pounce and it can be deadly since defenders won't know what's coming. There's a lot of potential to explore.

## Bleed Infect

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Zombie Engineers**</mark> and <mark style="color:yellow;">**Zombie Snipers**</mark> have access to the Southern Hospitality & Shiv - which can allow for some cheeky <mark style="color:red;">**bleed damage**</mark> that will allow you to infect Humans **from afar** if they don't have any healing to mitigate it; sometimes destroying an entire defense by just having a spontaneous zombie appear at an objective/door after you've landed a stray hit on them.

## Extra Demoknight Range

Very self explainatory title - zombies _already_ have increased range - and can get niche furhter bonus range with use of Demoman or Soldier sword weapons (albeit less damage) on specific high up Humans.

## Kill VS Infect

In some instances as zombie (notably zombie sniper) you are given tools to completely **obliterate** even a high HP class like Heavy without being airblasted away or backstabbed during the follow-up stun animation for infection. With the right weapon matchups in **damage vulnerabilities**, such as Warrior's Spirit or Backscratcher vs GRU, Powerjack etc you can easily find yourself outright killing a human rather than infecting them; letting you retain any movement without being committed to a stun on infect - allowing you to go for another _second_ kill right off the bat where just two might matter to destroy a defense.

## Alternative Win Conditions

As mentioned in the [**Zombie Mechanics Guide**](zombie-mechanics.md#additional-win-conditions), there are alternative win conditions the Zombie team can use to win a round aside from killing all the humans. One condition you can take advantage of is areas that, if zombies enter, will result in an instant loss for the Human team. You will primarily find these in final defenses. Heavies can exploit this the most by forcing themselves into these areas with their Mutations if the humans aren't prepared for them. Couple this with Soldier Mutations and the smoke from Pyro Mutations to completely blindside the Humans when this happens.

Example of using Mutations to forcefully enter an area and trigger a Human loss:
