# How to Play as Zombies

...amidst all the gunfire, rockets, and anything thrown your way. If you were recently infected, you cannot revive to become a human until the next round, so you have to make the best of your situation and put a stop to your former comrades. Luckily enough, you have **abilities** **unique to each class** _(and sometimes_ [_**items**_](../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/common-items.md#zombie-items)_)_ to help you out.&#x20;

## **You'll also need a LOT of patience as a Zombie...**

Ideally striking at moments or places where Humans will be slipping up, remember that rounds can go afar as <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[30+]**</mark> **minutes depending on map.** <mark style="color:red;">**Zombie gameplay isn't going to be an instant roll for holding your W key and occasionally pressing E - it'll be "boring" to get launched backwards on repeat**</mark> - but if you've killed _one Human_; that c_an_ be the momentum needed to roll the snowball effect into stopping them from winning or progressing to the next stage.&#x20;

~~_Or you just killed one of the many useless backstab farming spies, but hey maybe they'll switch to a good zombie class immediately after dying like an idiot._~~

## I didn't one shot infect!

This version of TF2 ZE does get experimental with its class variety on both zombies and humans - so _<mark style="color:red;">**not all**</mark>_ _<mark style="color:red;">**Zombies are equally built the same**</mark>_ and as a result; will do occasionally do less damage depending vastly on weapon interactions and their base class damages listed in the individual [**Meet the Zombies**](../../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-zombies/) pages.

* Some zombies such as Zombie Scout cannot one shot a Human and will take several hits to infect due to them being more akin to a support role.
* Some melee weapons equipped as a zombie might have a damage penalty - as weapons are balanced around Humans and typically carry the same stats over.
* The Human being hit might have _extra_ health! Most commonly through medic overheal, but sometimes weapons or map items give slightly more base HP.
* _(Warrior's Spirit, Backscratcher, or Jarate Enzyme into Bushwacka are all good examples of weapons that can counteract higher HP individuals due to their increased damage values.)_

In the follow-up [**overview**](zombie-mutations-overview.md) page contains the TLDRs for each class and their **Mutations.** You will be able to utilize each ability after gaining <mark style="color:yellow;">**100 \*Enzyme**</mark>**,** which is only gained upon taking direct damage from humans. This will fade on its own after <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[30] seconds**</mark>, but being damaged will reset that timer - so make sure you watch your enzyme status!

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note:**</mark> In-game _(and throughout the guide),_ almost everybody refers to Mutations simply as **Enzymes** - a common misnomer.
