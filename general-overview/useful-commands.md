  experience while playing.

# Useful Commands

{% hint style="info" %}
_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Note:**</mark>_ Each command is prefixed by an exclamation mark ( ! ) or a frontslash ( / ).&#x20;

Using an exclamation mark ( ! ) broadcasts your commands in chat.&#x20;

Using a frontslash (/) silences your commands, effectively stopping them from broadcasting in chat so long as the command is valid. Feel free to use it to avoid chat clutter or if you're feeling shy!

_These commands have now been organized: (a-z)_

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="227">Command</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>bhop</strong></td><td>Toggles on/off bhopping mechanics for the player. Certain maps might disable bhop mechanics entirely so this may not work universally.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>flashlight</strong></td><td><p>Emits a small light in front of you which can be useful on darker maps.</p><p></p><p>You can also achieve this effect by typing in </p><p><code>sm_flashlight</code> </p><p><em><strong>or</strong></em></p><p><code>mp_flashlight 1</code> </p><p><code>impulse 100</code></p><p>in your TF2 console. </p><ul><li>Note that you will have to perform extra steps to use mp_flashlight. Check the <a href="../miscellaneous-info/better-flashlight.md"><strong>Better Flashlight</strong></a> section.</li></ul><p>To turn off your flashlight, simply use this or the console command again.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>hideteam</strong></td><td><p>Hides the player models of those on your team. It does not hide players with items or players using custom cosmetics from the Skial item plugin.</p><p></p><p><em>You can also achieve this effect by typing in <code>sm_hideteam</code> in your TF2 console.</em></p><p></p><p>To unhide your teammates, simply use this or the console command again.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>ignore</strong></td><td><p>Mutes a specified player's voicechat only for yourself for the duration of the map. The player name specified as an argument will pattern match to the closest user. If multiple users share the same string pattern in their name, the command will fail and you will have to enter a more specific name.</p><p></p><p><mark style="color:yellow;"><strong>Example:</strong></mark> There are two users <strong>Johnny</strong> and <strong>Joe</strong></p><p>• /ignore Johnny- ignores Johnny </p><p>• /ignore John - pattern matches to Johnny and ignores Johnny </p><p>• /ignore Jo - pattern matches to multiple users and fails to execute</p><p>• /ignore Mama - pattern matches to no user currently on the server and fails</p><p></p><p>You can also type /ignore @all to mute everyone at once.</p><p></p><p>To unignore a player, simply use this command again with the player you wish to unmute.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>items</strong></td><td>Allows you to access the Skial item plugin, so you can equip and customize any cosmetics or items for use on the server.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>jointeam spectator</strong></td><td><p>Currently, normal players cannot join spectator until the end of a round - this command <em>(if binded)</em> lets you quickly do it without opening the UI in the short time frame you have.</p><p></p><p>With this command, you can <em><strong>(legally™)</strong></em> <mark style="color:red;"><strong>gain zombie priority</strong></mark> without inflating zombie numbers beyond intended, retain your scoreboard numbers, and not have to retry <em>(reconnect to the server)</em> entirely.</p><p><br>Use command <mark style="color:yellow;"><strong>at round end</strong></mark> > Wait in spectator until next round is in warmup phase > <mark style="color:blue;"><strong>Click BLU (Humans)</strong></mark> > You will be moved to top of the autobalance queue for zombie team.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>leadermenu</strong></td><td>A function that brings up the option to use leader markers without the use of voice-commands (leader only of course); <mark style="color:yellow;"><strong>this can also be used to enable leader voice-chat priority over all other speakers.</strong></mark></td></tr><tr><td><strong>logo</strong></td><td><em>this one actually isn't all that important it just toggles the very small 'Skial.com' logo that occasionally fades in and out near chat; if it annoys you as much as it does for me.</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>nextmap</strong></td><td>Specifically must be typed <strong>without</strong> a ! or / pre-fix; indicates whether or not the next map has already been voted upon and indicates the next map on round-end.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>nominate</strong></td><td><p>Provides a list of maps that you can choose from to add to the next map voting poll. Note that you can only nominate one map at a time and that some maps may not be able to be nominated due to a map cooldown. </p><p></p><p>The full map name does not need to be typed to select a map; </p><p><strong>eg</strong> nominate squid, nominate dead <em>(for Squid Game and Deadcore respectively.)</em><br></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>noshake</strong></td><td>Disables map screen-shaking features. Should work on Cosmo Canyon, Best Korea, etc...</td></tr><tr><td><strong>quitleader</strong></td><td>Allows you to quit the leader position and let other players become the leader. Once you quit being the leader, you cannot become it again for the duration of the round.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>rtv</strong></td><td>Allows you to Rock the Vote and contribute to a server poll of whether or not to change the map. Enough RTVs will cause the map to change on the next round or during the current round if a map change had already been queued by the server.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>stuck</strong></td><td><p>If stuck inside a prop or object, this will teleport you to the closest teammate. Does not work if you are the last one of your team alive. </p><p></p><p><em>You can also achieve this effect by typing in <code>sm_stuck</code> in your TF2 console.</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>thirdperson</strong>, <strong>tp</strong>,  <em>or</em> <strong>3</strong></td><td><p>Changes the camera into a third-person perspective.</p><p></p><p>To enter back into first-person perspective, simply use this command again. <strong>(Toggle on/off)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>vl</strong></td><td>Allow you to vote for a player to become the leader.
