# Boosting 101

## Boosting!

Off the get-go, boosting in Zombie Escape is an action of launching <mark style="color:red;">**zombies**</mark> _**towards**_ a defending team - or the map's objective in enough of a way to hinder a team into losing a defense, or even the round. Even if it was done unintentionally, it's still widely regarded as a _'**boost,'**_ such as a Soldier who just wants to build a [**Conch**](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/soldier/secondaries.md#concheror) to help the team healthy, but launches a zombie into the backlines of defense with explosion splash. Generally, boosting can be highly detrimental and this is here to give insight as to how to do it **less.**

## **Z-Velocity Stats?**

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Minus**</mark>_<mark style="color:yellow;">** **</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**Z-Velocity**</mark> is an attribute that can be found on several custom weapons _(and this is explained on their respective pages too)_ to outright circumvent boosting concerns; _(Direct Hit, Loose Cannon, Flare Gun, and Mannmelter.)_&#x20;

_But what does it do?_ Instead of 'boosting' the zombies vertically into the sky or onto a ledge where the zombie will have an advantageous momentum - <mark style="color:yellow;">**Minus Z-Velocity**</mark> will effectively 'spike' them downwards upon taking damage from any weapons with this attribute. _Incredibly_ useful if you need to deny zombie(s) from jumping over an object or ledge as they'll be repeatedly be forced down!

## Whose to blame?

Boosting in TF2 ZE is most _commonly_ correlated with the Soldier class the moment a zombie goes flying into an overdefender or spells the end of a vital defense - but they're <mark style="color:yellow;">**not the only one that can do it!**</mark>&#x20;

In fact, technically _**any**_ class can 'boost' in certain conditions, such as a zombie standing overhead and directly shooting them from beneath to fling them into an <mark style="color:red;">**unfavorable position**</mark> or causing a boost via [**wind items**](../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/#pushes)**.**

#### Though, some classes can do this more prominently than the others, here's most of the main culprits.

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Soldier**</mark>
  * [**Rockets**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Pyro**</mark>
  * [**Airblast**](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Demoman**</mark>
  * [**Grenades**](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Engineer**</mark>
  * [**Mini-Sentries**](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]

## Speed-Boosting

In most connotations, a speed-boost isn't necessarily a bad thing - it can allow for players or classes to make their retreat into a safer defending area much quicker.&#x20;

However, at times people might speed-boost _or also just 'boost'_ for the sole purpose of throwing off player movement _(as the extra speed can be unpredictable if you don't know when it'll wear out);_ commonly causing demises on parkour segments of maps due to slippery fast speed.

There's about three main ways this can happen to <mark style="color:blue;">**BLU**</mark> team for the moment - and only two that are 'controllable' - <mark style="color:red;">**the server will relay anyone using those in the console if problematic enough to call them out on it.**</mark>

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Scout**</mark> [<mark style="color:yellow;">**Bonk-Atomic-Punch.**</mark>](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/scout/secondaries.md#bonk-atomic-punch) Or just known as bonk - scout bonk only affects humans within the initial boost and does not linger onto any people that miss it.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Soldier**</mark> [<mark style="color:yellow;">**Concherer**</mark>](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/meet-the-humans-outdated-+weapons/soldier/secondaries.md#concheror)<mark style="color:yellow;">**.**</mark> Or just known as conch - soldier conching is significantly more noticeable due to both an audio cue in them blowing the horn; the green outlines, _and_ speed increase sound. The problem is that conch, unlike bonk - follows the user in a radius, buffing those that even miss it. And it wears out within a certain radius too. _So having your movement increase and decrease vastly before any jump..._
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Dying!**</mark> Yes, humans <mark style="color:yellow;">**dying**</mark> will temporarily increase the speed of all people around them for a tad burst - just enough to escape any zombies behind you. This has the same effect as bonk - but with a _way shorter_ duration.

## Utilizing Boosts <mark style="color:red;">(Zombie)</mark>

In the event that you happened to meet the misfortune of perishing and wish to seek vengeance upon all; as a zombie you can _**intentionally**_ keep an eye out for any of these methods of boosting and turn them into your favor _by_ getting hit or splashed around your feet and jumping frequently to send yourself flying airborne over defenders, making them spread out their focus into shooting you or even landing an aerial-drop-infect.

[^1]: Most Rockets are a big culprit due to their **unpredictability** when splashing them at the zombies' legs - at times giving zombies drastic movement or height advantages that the team can't quickly respond to before they land on a human for a free infection.&#x20;

[^2]: Airblasting _usually_ never gets this afar with it due to the resistance mechanic preventing spam - but situationally a pyro in panic may shove zombies into _you_ in moments where a defense is lost.

[^3]: Pills are Demoman's only way of knocking back zombies - but you should _**really**_ rely on your stickies instead and let your team push zombies back for you; unless you absolutely need to use them. These mostly run into the same problems that Rockets have but for way less reward..

[^4]: As for Sentries - this one is probable on ramp-like areas or attained through [**specific loadouts**](../human-zombie-guides-stats-here/human-meta-discussion-outdated-+loadouts/class-loadouts-demoman-heavy-engineer.md#sentinel-engineer) to increase knockback.
