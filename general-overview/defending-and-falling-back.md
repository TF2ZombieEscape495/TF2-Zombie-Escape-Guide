# Defending and Falling Back

## Defending and Falling Back

In essence, Zombie Escape is just shooting and running. However, the game mode has a huge "tug-o-war" feel where the <mark style="color:blue;">**`Human team`**</mark> will be given ground to either push back or hold off the Zombies, and the <mark style="color:red;">**`Zombie team`**</mark> will be given chances to charge and overwhelm the Humans. It's a game of <mark style="color:green;">**defending**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**falling back**</mark>**.** The Human team does have opportunities to apply some strategy to these two things for their own benefit should they be coordinated or smart enough to do so.

## Defending

Defending is primarily just holding areas until new ones open up, until people hit triggers, to protect objects, etc. _Usually_, there will be a timer that will pop up to let you know how long to hold until you can fall back or until something happens. There's not much to it other than shooting to protect yourself and the team.

## Overdefending

In order to properly overdefend, you will need to have a solid understanding of the map or a good leader who'll ensure you won't defend 'til an _**unexpected**_ death.\
\
But, to overdefend at your own discretion or rally others to help, you should know the following:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**The timings of the map (extent to which you can hold before TP or death)**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Locations of zombie TPs**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**The ratio of potential defenders to the amount of zombies**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Whether or not people will actually defend with you**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Whether or not the pros outweigh the cons**</mark>

\
Proper execution of an **overdefense** can majorly lessen the pressure on the Human team, resulting in fewer deaths. Sometimes it'll be _significantly_ easier to overdefend previous or current areas rather than newly opened ones. A tight chokepoint is significantly easier to defend than a wide open area after all. It may even be a necessary strategy to beat the round. In some cases, you'll be able to do it yourself, while in other cases, it'll be a team effort. These strategies always pose the risk of your own or even the team's death if some of the conditions above aren't met or considered. As a result, try to get a good feel for the map and the game mode before you try to do anything independently.

## Sacrifices

During this type of overdefense, you will be **expected** to die. Be it heroic or merely desperate, it's a way of making a last stand to ensure other survivors live or that the round will be won. You can expect these strategies to be employed when the team has so few numbers to reliably defend final areas or if the team absolutely wants to win the round. As long as the cause is met, you may find solace in your contribution.

## Falling Back

Similar to how one needs to know the timings of the map to overdefend, one must understand the timings for when to fall back. A team needs to hold or stall for an appropriate amount of time before booking it to prevent the event of being cornered and overwhelmed. But, if you fall back too late, you'll be swept up by zombie TPs and other events contributing to your death. _**Luckily, TF2 ZE offers a bunch of ways to speedboost those falling back, so try consider utilizing them to ensure the team's safety.**_ If you are new to maps, you may want to fall back a bit earlier to get a better understanding of what you can get away with or where you need to go.

## Stalling

Stalling consists of slowing the zombies down to give more breathing room for your team. This is especially prevalent if your team is low on numbers and can't hold the defense in the next area. It's really something you should only do if a leader says it's safe to do so or if you know the map well enough.&#x20;

## Triggering

Some people may fall back early to look for triggers to allow the team to progress to the next area. These may be comprised of objects you have to interact with or merely areas you need to enter. There should only be as many people going for them as there are triggers. So, if you're already familiar with where they are and how to get them, and if you notice too many people who also know what to do for them running back to trigger, it may be best to defend with the rest of the team.

## Doorhugging

Most people are tempted to fall back as far away from the zombies as possible at all times. It's a rational thought, but ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it'll lead to your team becoming overwhelmed by them and dying. It's best to avoid this if you're not triggering or if there's a defense you're completely ignoring. If your team or a leader explicitly says they can hold it for you, you can fall back if you're new to the map or game mode. Certain situations will call for doorhugging entirely, but those are few and far between.
