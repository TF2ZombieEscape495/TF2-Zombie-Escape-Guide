# How to Play as Humans

Similar to how Team Fortress 2 is a team-based game, Zombie Escape plays as one too. Since you're trying to survive, you might feel inclined to run away. In most cases, if everybody did that, then everyone would die! You have to help out your team so they can help you later on. Remember, a teammate dying results in one less ally and one more enemy. Don't doorhug unless it's absolutely safe to do so.

So now that you're not hiding in the back, you're stuck at the front. Defend! Stick by your teammates and watch each other's backs. Just make sure you don't edge too close to zombies such that you get hit, die, and can infect the others. Keep a safe distance and keep on shooting. Get the triggers then, when it's time to fall back, actually fall back! Don't overdefend and be left 4 dead.

Along the way will be a series of tasks to accomplish, areas to hold out on, or [**bosses**](../../elements-of-zombie-escape/npcs-and-bosses/bosses.md) to fight. Piled onto that might be [**parkour**](../../elements-of-zombie-escape/parkour.md), [**surf**](../../elements-of-zombie-escape/surf.md), and[ **other map elements**](../../elements-of-zombie-escape/items/). If you die, you will be autobalanced to <mark style="color:red;">**RED**</mark> to now fight as a Zombie. There's going to be _a lot_ thrown your way, so do your best to survive!

Within the follow-up [**overview**](human-class-overviews.md) page gives some very quick TL;DRs on what each class will typically offer up to the table for the survivors!
