# Contributing Guidelines

{% hint style="info" %}
Anybody can contribute! **(So long as they have a github account.)** Should be a given, but you'll need one to make **pull (edit) requests** to the main branch - which in turn will sync to this Gitbook space if approved & merged manually!
{% endhint %}

## How do I use Github?

{% embed url="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects" %}
This redirect gives a pretty good rundown on the functionality of Github if you've never used it before - there's definitely a lot to take in.
{% endembed %}

## Where do I contribute?

{% embed url="https://github.com/TF2ZombieEscape495/TF2-Zombie-Escape-Guide" %}
The main page of 'code' - anything can be edited here but must be merged to go live on the Gitbook.

## Some Rules

Not adhering to these guidelines may end up in your pull request (edit) being denied.

* Gitbook & Github TOS.
* Keep the space professional-looking; this is a resource for people learning any bit of info this game-mode has to offer. (albeit some jokes are okay, don't overdo them.)
  * No images or text that don't relate to the game-mode. _(Unless in Afterthoughts.)_
* Use Request Descriptions!! Not expecting an essay on the whys - but it helps streamline the process of getting your request merged quicker.
  * Don't just randomly remove important chunks of content from pages unless it's gone from the game itself or too outdated to use.
  * Currently only allowing _edits_ to _**existing**_ pages due to unforeseen problems with syncing and creating brand new pages; consult in the [**Skial Discord**](https://discord.com/channels/194243889505370113/1121291195667193927) about adding or removing any particular pages of content! Ping @not\_pickles if you need attention to something.
