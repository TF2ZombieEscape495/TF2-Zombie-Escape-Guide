# What is Zombie Escape?

Ever play CS or GMod Zombie Escape and wonder how it might translate to TF2? Ever play TF2 and wonder how classes might fit into ZE? The aim of the game is the same, but, in TF2, things can get a bit interesting...\
\
Zombie Escape is a mod originating from <mark style="color:purple;">**Counter-Strike: Source**</mark> where there are two teams: <mark style="color:blue;">**counter-terrorists**</mark> as the <mark style="color:blue;">**humans**</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">**terrorists**</mark> as the <mark style="color:red;">**zombies**</mark>. The primary objective for the Human team is to survive against the Zombie team and "escape" the map after a series of chokes, holds, and events. The objective for the zombies is to kill all humans, which they can _usually_ accomplish with one hit. Teams will initially be stacked in favor of humans with very few zombies, but this can quickly change over the course of maps and snowball in favor of the zombies.\
\
To defend themselves, the humans have access to the wide array of guns found in the base game but with modified amounts of knockback to better space themselves from the zombies. Even grenades are accessible as utilities to further stall and create space. But what tools do the zombies have? Just their knives primarily. To compensate, they are given tremendous amounts of health to withstand all the constant gunfire and are given a near instant respawn to continually apply pressure. Some Source Engine tricks here and there can help both teams too.\
\
All of this encapsulates a simple concept: there are a bunch of people with guns shooting and running away from an endless, player controlled horde. _However,_ this simple premise has evolved over the years to incorporate new quirks and concepts. Aside from zombies, now you have to worry about: [**parkour**](elements-of-zombie-escape/parkour.md)**,** [**bosses**](elements-of-zombie-escape/npcs-and-bosses/bosses.md)**,** [**surf**](elements-of-zombie-escape/surf.md)**,** [**special items**](elements-of-zombie-escape/items/), [_**lasers**_](elements-of-zombie-escape/lasers/), and much, much more. There's a lot of nuance under the surface, and it's all dependent on what mappers implement or what servers hosting the game mode include.
