# Editor Notes

<mark style="color:yellow;">**edited 1/6/2025**</mark>

Ordered through high priority to least priority:

1. Re-calc weapon damage stats (including DPS)
2. Apply above to Optimal DPS subpage (update the visual too)
3. find all mentions of sniper stun headshot mechanics > replace with updated KB headshot mechanic _(Human mechanics, weapon pages...)_
4. Move Bhopping page out of highlights back to Elements eventually
5. trim the zombie meta pages or just kill them outright _(they're too much yap that can be streamlined)_
6. _Z&#x6F;_&#x6D;bie Soldier enzyme gif _(bhop > sword range kill overdefender with minicrits)_
7. Zombie Scout enzyme gif
8. How to play as Zombies Banner _(very low prio because entirely dependent on Gitbook fixing their broken banners)_
9. **Integrate ZE Guide into a traditional wiki page** _(where anyone can edit)_ for longevity; _(**very** time consuming, would have to re-format literally everything and find new ways to lay it out.)_
