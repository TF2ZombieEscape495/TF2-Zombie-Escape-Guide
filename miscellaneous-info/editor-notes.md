# Editor Notes

<mark style="color:yellow;">**edited 1/31/2025**</mark>

Ordered through high priority to least priority:

1. add gameplay example gifs to !zload page
2. move bhopping & zload to Overview section once they're more established/widely known
3. possible revamp of (weapon stat pages) to trim down on textwalls of specific weapons - think bullet points of niches/flaws etc&#x20;
4.
5. **Integrate ZE Guide into a traditional wiki page&#x20;**_**(where anyone can edit)**_**&#x20;for longevity;&#x20;**_**(very time consuming, would have to re-format literally everything and find new ways to lay it out.)**_
