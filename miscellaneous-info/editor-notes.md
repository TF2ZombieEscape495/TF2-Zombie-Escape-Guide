# Editor Notes

<mark style="color:yellow;">**edited 1/12/2025**</mark>

Ordered through high priority to least priority:



1. dedicated !zload page required
2. Re-calc weapon damage stats (including DPS)
3. Apply above to Optimal DPS subpage (update the visual too)
4. Zombie Soldier Enzyme reworked; edit visual + any mention of. Maybe gif too.
5. find all mentions of sniper stun headshot mechanics > replace with updated KB headshot mechanic _(Human mechanics, weapon pages...)_
6. Move Bhopping page out of highlights back to Elements eventually
7. trim the zombie meta pages or just kill them outright _(they're too much yap that can be streamlined)_
8. Zombie Scout enzyme gif
9. How to play as Zombies Banner _(very low prio because entirely dependent on Gitbook fixing their broken banners)_
10. **Integrate ZE Guide into a traditional wiki page&#x20;**_**(where anyone can edit)**_**&#x20;for longevity;&#x20;**_**(very time consuming, would have to re-format literally everything and find new ways to lay it out.)**_
