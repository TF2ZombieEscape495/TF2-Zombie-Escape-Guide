# Editor Notes

<mark style="color:yellow;">**edited 1/12/2025**</mark>

Ordered through high priority to least priority:

1. dedicated !zload page required
2. Re-calc weapon damage stats (including DPS)
3. Apply above to Optimal DPS subpage (update the visual too)
4. Move Bhopping page out of highlights back to Elements eventually
5. **Integrate ZE Guide into a traditional wiki page&#x20;**_**(where anyone can edit)**_**&#x20;for longevity;&#x20;**_**(very time consuming, would have to re-format literally everything and find new ways to lay it out.)**_
