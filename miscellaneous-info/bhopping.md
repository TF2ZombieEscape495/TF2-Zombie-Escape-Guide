# Bhopping

Similar to surfing, bhopping is a gameplay element with resources available that cover it extensively. If you want to learn how to do it, there are a plethora of guides and video references to look through, as well as maps to practice on. This section briefly addresses it and its niche usage in TF2 ZE.

As a summary, bhopping in TF2 ZE is, **in most cases**, negligible. While the variety of movement options can make up for speed increases, it won't discount you from using bhops for a small edge. Those familiar with bhopping in CS:S and who can see the issues with it in CS:GO can also expect similar issues in TF2. It's inconsistent to execute and the gains are minimal. The latter is rectified by additional plugins or increasing the cap on velocity and acceleration values, but there is no such thing currently implemented for TF2 ZE.

Despite this, it _**does**_ have some applications. One could argue they're absolutely minor, yet their utility value is case dependent. Here are some scenarios for consideration.

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rushing for Triggers**</mark>
  * Lessen the pressure on teammates during tight holds. Minor time difference, but even that can be important at times.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rushing for Items**</mark>
  * Rush ahead of teammates to yoink items or save them from a person who won't use them properly.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Parkour**</mark>
  * Particularly for hard strafe jumps or jumps in general. Extra speed helps in covering that extra distance.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Falling Back**</mark>
  * Zombies are slightly faster than humans. Use bhops to outpace them or even make tight timings if falling back particularly late.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Infecting Fleeing Humans**</mark>
  * Use that extra bit of speed to catch up faster to humans running away - especially those who won't expect you moving so fast.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Mutation Support**</mark>
  * Use them tactfully to rush in faster or get behind unexpectedly quicker depending on which class you're playing.
