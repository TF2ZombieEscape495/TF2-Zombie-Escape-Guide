# Map Guides

There are _a lot_ of maps in Zombie Escape, and it might be daunting to approach them all with a blind eye. Maybe you want to prepare yourself, or maybe you want to go a step further as a leader and figure out some of the cool and secret strats you can do.

Whatever the reason, it can be fascinating to see how a map has been dissected and how you can approach it from the perspective of players other than the mapper(s).&#x20;

Guides aren't the _end-all and be-all_ of tackling a map, but they can serve as a handy reference for those willing to learn.
